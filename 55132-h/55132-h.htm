<p>The present and last of this series of readings in German
history includes an outline of the historical changes and great
events of the period of nearly four hundred years since the
Reformation. Though condensed to a very great degree, it
furnishes the reader a survey of that important period, and will
afford him a helpful basis for his future study of the history of
Germany. The reading closes with a selection from the pen
of the poet and historian, Schiller, descriptive of the battle of
Lutzen, where Gustavus Adolphus, that greatest character and
hero of the Thirty Years’ War, met his fate.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h4>SUMMARY OF GERMAN HISTORY FROM THE REFORMATION TO
THE PRESENT TIME.</h4>

<p>From the death of Luther, 1546, to the end of the century the
struggle continued. Now and then there came a brief pause to
the general strife, such as followed the Treaty of Passau, or the
Religious Peace of Augsburg, but it was soon renewed by the
tyranny or treachery of the Catholic powers, whose hatred of
the followers of Luther and of the spirit of protestantism did
not abate till Europe had passed through the most terrible and
disastrous war of history. This was the thirty years’ war, dating
from 1618 to 1648, and involving not only the whole German
Empire, but also the principal states of Europe. Seldom,
if ever, has there been known such depletion of population and
resources. It was finally brought to an end by the peace of
Westphalia, when the worn-out and impoverished states subscribed
to a treaty which gave comparative toleration in Germany.
Under its conditions, in all religious questions Protestants
were to have an equal weight with Catholics in the
high courts and diet of the empire. The Calvinists were also
included with the Lutheran and Reformed creeds in this religious
peace. By its termination of the religious wars in Europe
the peace of Westphalia forms a great landmark in history.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century, from the thirty years’ war on to
its close, might not inappropriately be called the period of pusillanimity
in Germany. Public buildings, schools and churches
were allowed to stand as ruins while the courts of petty princes
were aping the stiff, formal, artificial manners of that of the
French monarch, Louis XIV. The latter seeing the weakened
state of the empire seized the opportunity to enlarge his own
kingdom at the expense of Germany. He laid claim to Brabant
and many of the fortresses of the frontier fell into the
hands of the French. His ambition was only checked by the
intervention of Holland, England and Sweden, and the war
terminated by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. Meanwhile the
Turks in alliance with the Hungarians marched with an army
of 200,000 up the Danube and encamped around the walls of
Vienna. There is good evidence that they were aided and abetted
in this invasion by Louis XIV. The Emperor Leopold fled,
leaving his capital to its fate. But the little guard of 13,000
men under Count Stahremberg held the fortifications against
the invader’s overwhelming force till Duke Charles of Lorraine
and the Elector of Saxony with their armies, and still another
army of 20,000 Poles under their king John Sobieski came to
their relief. The Turkish army was routed and driven into
Hungary. All this time Louis, like an eager bird of prey, was
watching Germany. Finally, in 1688, two powerful French
armies appeared upon the Rhine. The allied states at last
saw their imminent danger and rallied to resist and drive back
the common foe. Louis resolved to ruin if he could not possess
the country; so he adopted a course than which a more
wanton and barbarous was never known, even in the annals of
savagism. Vines were pulled up, fruit-trees cut down, and
villages burned to the ground. Multitudes of defenseless people
were slain in cold blood, and 400,000 persons beggared.
Germany, aroused at last, now entered with vigor into the war
with France, and carried it on till both sides were weary and
exhausted. It was concluded by the Treaty of Ryswick.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century dawned, still to witness Germany the
arena of war. Indeed from earliest history her soil, especially
along the Rhine, had been the battle-ground of Europe. This
time it was the war of the Spanish succession, whose tangled
episodes and details we can not undertake to follow. It will
be remembered by the student of history for its great battle of
Blenheim, where the allied armies under the Duke of Marlborough
and Prince Eugene defeated and routed the French.
Louis XIV. was now old, infirm, and tired of war, and hence
consented to a treaty of peace, which was concluded March 7,
1714.</p>

<p>The century now begun witnessed the rise of Prussia out of
the German chaos and the wonderful and brilliant career of
Frederick the Great. It also saw the stronger and more enlightened
reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph II. in Austria.</p>

<p>Though the wars never ceased, breaking out again in one
quarter while peace was being concluded in another, yet the
century as a whole gave prophesy of a coming better state of
affairs.</p>

<p>The grandfather of Frederick the Great had founded the
university of Halle in 1694, and in 1711 an academy of science
was established in Berlin upon a plan drawn up by the philosopher
Leibnitz. Frederick William I., father of Frederick
the Great, though coarse and brutal in his nature, had the wisdom
to see the importance of German education and of breaking
off from the established custom of imitating French manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and life. He accordingly established four hundred schools
among the people, and by the vigor and economy of his reign
contributed to the development of the character and individuality
of his people. Frederick the Great and his rival, Maria
Theresa, possessed greater elements of personal character and
intelligence than their predecessors, and hence gave to their
subjects, if not a more liberal form, at least a higher order of
government. Contemporary with these was the beginning of
that literary bloom which, by the genius of Lessing, Herder,
Klopstock, Goethe and Schiller, gave to Germany a glory surpassing
all she has ever achieved, either by war or statesmanship.</p>

<p>We have now reached, just before the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the time of the French Revolution. It was a
time that required great political prudence on the part of the
rulers in Germany. Unhappily the successors of Frederick the
Great and Joseph II. were incompetent to their responsibilities.
That great military genius that rose out of the turmoil and
chaos of the revolution in France is soon marching through
Germany, and on the 6th of August, 1806, Francis II., the last
of the line, laid down his title of “Emperor of the Holy Roman
Empire of the German nation” at the feet of Napoleon. Thus,
just a thousand years after Charlemagne the empire of his
founding passed away. It had culminated under the Hohenstauffens,
and for a long time before its formal burial had existed
in tradition rather than in fact. Truly may it be said that
Germany was as far as ever from being a nation at the beginning
of our century.</p>

<p>From 1806 to 1814 Germany underwent the humiliation of
subjection to the power of Napoleon. By a succession of victories,
such as Jena and Auerstädt, he cowed the spirit of the
German princes and proceeded to construct the famous
“Rhine-Bund” which made him protector over a territory embracing
fourteen millions of German inhabitants, and imposed
upon the states and principalities included conditions the most
exacting and disgraceful. Prussia and Austria, which held out
at first, were also compelled by force of his victorious armies to
yield, and Napoleon dictated terms to all Germany. He
marched in triumph into Berlin and Vienna; he changed
boundaries, levied troops, prescribed the size of their standing
armies at will, and when he set out on his campaign against
Alexander of Prussia 200,000 previously conquered Germans
marched at his command. Such was the abject state of Germany
during those years when it seemed that all Europe must
bend before the insatiate conqueror. But in the year 1813 the
spirit of liberty began to live again. The revival began, however,
not with the princes, but in the breasts of the people.
The works of the great German authors were becoming familiar
to them and were producing their effect. Klopstock was
awakening a pride in the German name and race; Schiller was
thrilling the popular heart with his doctrine of resistance to oppression,
whilst the songs of Körner and Arndt were inspiring
courage and hope. All classes of the people participated in
the uprising, and within a few months Prussia had an army of
270,000 soldiers in the field ready to resist the power of France.
This was the beginning of the turn in the tide of affairs which
led in 1815 to the overthrow of Napoleon at Waterloo, and
gave liberation to Germany.</p>

<p>The remaining history of the present century is that of the
Confederation formed in 1815 and lasting till 1866; of the North
German Confederation which succeeded the above, and continued
to the establishing of the present empire in 1871, as a
result of the Franco-Prussian war; and of the new empire to
the present time. The confederation of 1815, known as the
“Deutscher Bund,” embraced a part of Austria, most of Prussia,
the kingdoms of Bavaria, Würtemberg, Saxony and Hanover,
the electorate of Hesse-Cassel, a number of duchies,
principalities and free cities; in all thirty-nine states.</p>

<p>When in 1866 the “Bund” was dissolved and the North German
Confederation formed, Austria was excluded, and Prussia
assumed the headship of the new compact which embraced
the states north of the Main. The term Germany, from 1866
to 1871, designated the new Confederation, and the four South
German States, Bavaria, Würtemberg, Baden and Hesse
Darmstadt. The four latter had been made independent states,
but were united with the North German Confederation by the
Zollverein, and by alliances offensive and defensive.</p>

<p>The late war between France and Germany belongs to the
history of the present generation. Its great events and changes
to Germany are within the memory of many of our readers. It
will be longest remembered because of its association with the
formation of the present empire. While the siege of Paris was
yet in progress (January 1871) the spirit of enthusiasm became
so great, and the desire for national unity so strong, that the
various sovereign states, as well as the members of the Confederation
determined on a revival of the empire. At their joint
instance, in the great hall of Louis XIV., at Versailles, King
William of Prussia received the imperial crown with the title of
German Emperor. Under this new empire the whole German
nation, Austria alone excepted, is united more closely than it has
been for more than six hundred years, or since the Great Interregnum.
It is not too much to say that the last decade has been
the brightest and most prosperous in German history. The new
empire has made possible and developed a feeling of patriotism
which could not exist while the race was divided into fifty or more
separate states. It was the complaint of her greatest poet,
Goethe, that there was no united Germany to awaken pride and
patriotism in the German heart. That condition of things is now
done away by the present national government, which, though
retaining many of the imperial features of the past, has, at the
same time, embodied some of the more liberal governmental
ideas of the present age. Such, for instance, is the election by
direct universal suffrage and by ballot, of the Reichstag, one of
the two legislative councils of the empire. The German name
was never more respected and honored throughout the world than
it is to-day; not alone for her eminent position among the powers
of Europe, but for her high rank in the empires of art, philosophy
and science. Her great universities are admired wherever
in the world there is appreciation for scholarship, industry
and genius. If the present has any right to prophesy it must
be that the coming years contain for Germany less of wars and
dissension, more of peace, coöperation and unity.</p>

<h4>BATTLE OF LUTZEN—DEATH OF GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS.</h4>

<p>“At last the fateful morning dawned, but an impenetrable fog,
which spread over the plain, delayed the attack till noon.…
‘God with us!’ was the war cry of the Swedes; ‘Jesus
Maria!’ that of the Imperialists. About eleven the fog began
to disperse, and the enemy became visible. At the same
moment Lutzen was seen in flames, having been set on fire by
command of the duke, to prevent his being outflanked on that
side. The charge was now sounded; the cavalry rushed upon
the enemy, and the infantry advanced against the trenches.</p>

<p>“Received by a tremendous fire of musketry and heavy artillery,
these intrepid battalions maintained the attack with undaunted
courage, till the enemy’s musketeers abandoned
their posts, the trenches were passed, the battery carried and
turned against the enemy. They pressed forward with irresistible
impetuosity; the first of the five imperial brigades
was immediately routed, the second soon after, and the third
put to flight. But here the genius of Wallenstein opposed
itself to their progress. With the rapidity of lightning he was
on the spot to rally his discomfited troops; and his powerful
word was itself sufficient to stop the flight of the fugitives.
Supported by three regiments of cavalry, the vanquished brigades,
forming anew, faced the enemy, and pressed vigorously
into the broken ranks of the Swedes. A murderous conflict
ensued.… In the meantime the king’s right wing, led
by himself, had fallen upon the enemy’s left. The first impetuous
shock of the heavy Finland cuirassiers dispersed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
lightly mounted Poles and Croats, who were posted here,
and their disorderly flight spread terror and confusion among
the rest of the cavalry. At this moment notice was brought
to the king, that his infantry was retreating over the trenches,
and also that his left wing, exposed to a severe fire from the
enemy’s cannon posted at the windmills, was beginning to give
way. With rapid decision he committed to General Horn the
pursuit of the enemy’s left, while he flew, at the head of the
regiment of Steinback, to repair the disorder of his right wing.
His noble charger bore him with the velocity of lightning
across the trenches, but the squadrons that followed could
not come on with the same speed, and only a few horsemen,
among whom was Francis Albert, Duke of Saxe-Lauenberg,
were able to keep up with the king. He rode directly to the
place where his infantry were most closely pressed, and while
he was reconnoitering the enemy’s line for an exposed point to
attack, the shortness of his sight unfortunately led him too
close to their ranks. An imperial Gefreyter, remarking that
every one respectfully made way for him as he rode along, immediately
ordered a musketeer to take aim at him. ‘Fire at
him yonder,’ said he, ‘that must be a man of consequence.’
The soldier fired, and the king’s left arm was shattered. At that
moment his squadron came hurrying up, and a confused cry of
‘the king bleeds! the king is shot!’ spread terror and consternation
through all the ranks. ‘It is nothing, follow me,’
cried the king, collecting his whole strength; but overcome by
pain, and nearly fainting, he requested the Duke of Lauenberg,
in French, to lead him unobserved out of the tumult.
While the duke proceeded toward the right wing with the king,
to keep this discouraging sight from the disordered infantry,
his majesty received a second shot through the back, which
deprived him of his remaining strength. ‘Brother,’ said he,
with a dying voice, ‘I have enough! look only to your own
life.’ At the same moment he fell from his horse, pierced by
several more shots; and abandoned by all his attendants, he
breathed his last amidst the plundering bands of the Croats.
His charger flying without its rider, and covered with blood,
soon made known to the Swedish cavalry the fall of their king.
They rushed madly forward to rescue his sacred remains from
the hands of the enemy. A murderous conflict ensued over
the body, till his mangled remains were buried beneath a heap
of slain. Bernard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, gave to the bereaved
Swedes a noble leader in his own person; and the spirit
of Gustavus led his victorious squadrons anew.</p>

<p>“The sun was setting when the two lines closed. The strife
grew hotter as it drew to an end; the last efforts of strength
were mutually exerted, and skill and courage did their utmost to
repair in these precious moments the fortune of the day. It
was in vain; despair endows every one with superhuman
strength; no one can conquer, no one will give way. The art
of war seemed to exhaust its powers on one side, only to unfold
some new and untried masterpiece of skill on the other.
Night and darkness at last put an end to the fight, before the
fury of the combatants was exhausted; and the contest only
ceased, when no one could any longer find an antagonist.
Both armies separated, as if by tacit agreement; the trumpets
sounded, and each party claiming the victory, quitted the
field.”</p>

<h4>The Cataracts of the Orinoco.</h4>

<p>The impression which a scene makes upon us is not so
deeply fixed by the peculiarities of the country as by the light,
the clear azure or the deep shade of low lying clouds, under
which hill and river lie. In the same way descriptions of scenes
impress us with more or less force according as they harmonize
with our emotions. In our inner susceptible soul the physical
world is reflected true and life-like. What gives its peculiar
character to a landscape, to the outline of the mountain range
which borders the dimly distant horizon, to the darkness of the
pine forest, to the mountain stream which rushes madly between
overhanging cliffs? They all stand in strange mysterious
relations with the inner life of man, and on these relations rest
the nobler share of enjoyment which nature affords. Nowhere
does she impress us more strongly with consciousness of her
greatness; nowhere does she speak more powerfully to us
than under the Indian heavens. If I venture here to describe
that country may I hope that its peculiar charm will not remain
unfelt? The memory of a distant richly-endowed land, the
glimpse of a luxuriant, vigorous plant-life refreshes and
strengthens the mind as the restless worn spirit finds pleasure
in youth and its strength.</p>

<p>Western currents and tropical winds favor the voyage over
the peaceful straits which fill up the wide valley between
America and western Africa. Before the coast appears one notices
that the waves foam and dash over each other. Sailors
who were unacquainted with the region would suspect shallows
to be near, or fresh water springs, such as are in mid ocean
among the Antilles. As the garnet coast of Guiana draws near
there appears the wide mouth of a mighty stream. It bursts
forth like a shoreless sea and covers the surrounding ocean
with fresh water. The name Orinoco which the first discoverers
gave to the river, and which owes its origin to a confusion
of language, is unknown in the interior of the country, for the
uncivilized inhabitants give names to only those objects which
might easily be mistaken for others. The Orinoco, the Amazon,
the Magdalena are called simply the river, in some cases
perhaps, the great river, the great water, when the inhabitants
wish to distinguish them from a small stream.</p>

<p>The current which the Orinoco causes between the continent
of South America and the island of Trinidad is so powerful
that ships which attempt to struggle against it with outspread
sails are scarcely able to make any headway. This desolate
and dangerous place is called the Gulf of Sorrow; the entrance
is the Dragon’s Head. Here lonely cliffs rise tower-like in the
raging flood. They mark the old, rocky isthmus which, cut off
by the current, once joined the island of Trinidad and the
coast of Venezuela.</p>

<p>The appearance of this country first convinced the hardy
discoverer, Colon, of the existence of the American continent.
Acquainted with nature as he was he concluded that so monstrous
a body of fresh water could only be collected by a great
number of streams, and that the land which supplied this water
must be a continent and not an island. As the followers of
Alexander believed the Indus, filled with crocodiles, was a
branch of the Nile, so Colon concluded that this new continent
was the easterly coast of the far away Asia. The coolness of
the evening air, the clearness of the starry firmament, the perfume
of the flowers borne on the breeze, all led him to believe
that he had approached the garden of Eden, the sacred home
of the first human beings. The Orinoco seemed to him one of
the four streams which are said to flow from Paradise, and to
water the plants of the newly-planted earth.</p>

<p>This poetical passage taken from Colon’s diary has a peculiar
interest. It shows anew how the fancies of the poet are
in the discoverer as in every great human character.</p>

<p>The French are the chosen people of the new religion, its first gospels

<p>When Candide came to Eldorado, he saw in the streets a number of boys
who were playing with gold nuggets instead of marbles. This degree of
luxury made him imagine that they must be the king’s children, and he
was not a little astonished when he found that in Eldorado gold nuggets
are of no more value than marbles are with us, and that the school-boys
play with them. A similar thing happened to a friend of mine, a foreigner,
when he came to Germany and first read German books. He was perfectly
astounded at the wealth of ideas which he found in them; but he soon
remarked that ideas in Germany are as plentiful as gold nuggets in Eldorado,
and that those writers whom he had taken for intellectual princes,
were in reality only common school-boys.</p>

<p>He was an admirable dialectician, and did more than any other writer
to promote in Germany a sympathetic study of Plato. Yet there is a
touch of Romanticism in the vague, shadowy and mystic language in
which he presents the elements of Christian thought and life.—<i>Sime.</i></p>

<p>Wilhelm Von Humboldt says that Schleiermacher’s speaking far
exceeded his power in writing, and that his strength consisted in the
“deeply penetrative character of his words, which was free from art, and
the persuasive effusion of feeling moving in perfect unison with one of
the rarest intellects.”—<i>American Cyclopædia.</i></p>

<h4>Extracts From Schleiermacher.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">True Pleasure.</span>—Pleasure is a flower which grows indeed
of itself, but only in fruitful gardens and well cultivated fields.
Not that we should labor in our minds to gain it; but yet he
who has not labored for it, with him it will not grow; whoever
has not brought out in his own character something profitable
and praiseworthy, it is in vain for him to sow. Even he who
understands it best can do nothing better for the pleasure of
another than that he should communicate to him what is the
foundation of his own. Whosoever does not know how to
work up the rough stuff for himself, and thereby make it his
own, whosoever does not refine his disposition, has not secured
for himself a treasure of thoughts, a many sidedness of relations,
a view of the world and human things peculiar to himself—such
a man knows not how to seize the proper occasion
for pleasure, and the most important is assuredly lost for him.
It is not the indolent who finds so much difficulty in filling up
the time set aside for repose. Who find vexation and ennui in
everything? From whom are we hearing never ending complaints
about the poverty and dull uniformity of life? Who are
most bitter in their lamentations over the slender powers of
men for social intercourse, and over the insufficiency of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
measures to obtain joy? But this is only what they deserve;
for man cannot reap where he has not sown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Esteem of the World.</span>—We all consider what is
thought of us by those around us as a substantial good. Trust in
our uprightness of character, belief in our abilities, and the
desire that arises from this to be more intimately connected
with us, and to gain our good opinion, everything of this kind
is often a more valuable treasure than great riches. Of this
the indolent are quite aware. If men would only believe in
their capacity without the necessity of producing anything
painstaking and really praiseworthy! If they would only agree
to take some other proof of their probity and love of mankind
than deeds! If they would only accept some other security
for their wisdom than prudent language, good counsel, and a
sound judgment on the proper mode of conducting the affairs
of life! Instead of rising to a true love of honor, such men
creep amidst childish vanities, which try to fix the attention
of mankind by pitiful trifles and to glitter by shadowy appearances;
instead of attempting to reach something really noble,
they rest only on external customs; the mental disposition that
arises from this is their virtue, and their governing passion is
what they regard as understanding.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A young man not understood.—<i>Goethe.</i></p>

<p>German philosophers have as a rule been utterly indifferent to style,
but Schopenhauer’s prose is clear, firm and graceful, and to this fact he
owes much of his popularity.—<i>Sime.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Our inductive science ends with the questions—“Whence?”
“Wherefore?” We observe facts, and classify them; but then
follows a question respecting the substance that lies behind the
facts? What do they express? What is the Will of which
they are the Representation?—If we were isolated from the
world around us, we could not answer the question. But we
are not so isolated. We belong to nature, and nature is included
in ourselves. We have in ourselves the laws of the
world around us. We find in our own bodies the mechanical
laws, and those of the organic life manifested in plants and animals.
We have the same understanding which we find working
around us in the system of nature. If we consisted only of
the body and the understanding, we could not distinguish ourselves
from nature. If we know what is in ourselves, we know
what is in nature. Now what do we find controlling the facts
of our own natural life? An impulse which we may call the
Will to live. We often use the word Will in a complex sense,
as implying both thought and choice; but in its purest, simplest
sense, as the word is used here, it means the impulse, or
force, which is the cause of a phenomenon. In this sense,
there is a Will from which the movements within the earth and
upon its surface derive their origin. It works continuously
upward from the forms of crystals, through the forms of zoöphytes,
mollusca, annelida, insectia, arachnida, crustacea, pisces,
reptilia, aves, and mammalia. There is one Will manifested in
the growth of all plants and animals. That which we call a purpose
when viewed as associated with intellect, is, when regarded
most simply, or in itself, a force or impulse—the natural
Will of which we are now speaking. It is the Will to live—the
mighty impulse by which every creature is impelled to maintain
its own existence, and without any care for the existence of
others. It is an unconscious Egoism. Nature is apparently a
collection of many wills; but all are reducible to one—the Will
to live. Its whole life is a never-ending warfare. It is forever
at strife <i>with itself</i>; for it asserts itself in one form to deny
itself as asserted in other forms. It is everywhere furnished
with the means of working out its purpose. Where the Will of
the lion is found, we find the powerful limbs, the claws, the
teeth necessary for supporting the life to which the animal is
urged by his Will. The Will is found associated in man with
an understanding; but is not subservient to that understanding.
On the contrary, the understanding or intellect is subservient.
The Will is the moving power; the understanding is
the instrument.</p>

<p>This one Will in nature and in ourselves serves to explain a
great part of all the movements of human society. Hence
arise the collisions of interest that excite envy, strife, and
hatred between individuals or classes. Society differs from an
unsocial state of life in the forms imposed by intelligence on
egoistic Will, but not in any radical change made in that Will.
Thus etiquette is the convenience of egoism, and law is a fixing
of boundaries within which egoism may conveniently pursue
its objects. The world around us, including what is called the
social or civilized world, may seem fair, when it is viewed only
as a stage, and without any reference to the tragedy that is
acted upon it. But, viewed in its reality, it is an arena for
gladiators, or an amphitheater where all who would be at peace
have to defend themselves. As Voltaire says, it is with sword
in hand that we must live and die. The man who expects to
find peace and safety here is like the traveler told of in one of
Gracian’s stories, who, entering a district where he hoped to
meet his fellow-men, found it peopled only by wolves and
bears, while men had escaped to caves in a neighboring forest.
The same egoistic Will that manifests itself dimly in the lowest
stages of life, and becomes more and more clearly pronounced
as we ascend to creatures of higher organization, attains its
highest energy in man, and is here modified, but not essentially
changed, by a superior intelligence. The insect world is
full of slaughter; the sea hides from us frightful scenes of cruel
rapacity; the tyrannical and destructive instinct marks the so-called
king of birds, and rages in the feline tribes. In human
society, some mitigation of this strife takes place as the result
of experience and culture. By the use of the understanding,
the Will makes laws for itself, so that the natural <i>bellum omnium
contra omnes</i> is modified, and leaves to the few victors
some opportunities of enjoying the results of their victory.
Law is a means of reducing the evils of social strife to their
most convenient form, and politics must be regarded in the
same way. The strength of all law and government lies in
our dread of the anarchic Will, that lies couched behind the
barriers of society and is ready to spring forth when they are
broken down.</p>

<h3>V.—THE SEA.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Continued.]</span></h3>

<p>The sea is full of life, both of plants and animals. These
organisms die, and their remains necessarily get mixed up with
the different materials laid down upon the sea floor. So that,
beside the mere sand and mud, great numbers of shells,
corals, and the harder parts of other sea creatures must be
buried there, as generation after generation comes and goes.</p>

<p>It often happens that on parts of the sea bed the remains of
some of these animals are so abundant that they themselves
form thick and wide-spread deposits. Oysters, for example,
grow thickly together; and their shells, mingled with those of
other similar creatures, form what are called shell banks. In
the Pacific and the Indian Oceans a little animal, called the
coral-polyp, secretes a hard limy skeleton from the sea water;
and as millions of these polyps grow together, they form great
reefs of solid rock, which are sometimes, as in the Great Barrier
Reef of Australia, hundreds of feet thick and a thousand
miles long. It is by means of the growth of these animals that
those wonderful rings of coral rock or coral islands are formed
in the middle of the ocean. Again, a great part of the bed of
the Atlantic Ocean is covered with fine mud, which on examination
is found to consist almost wholly of the remains of very
minute animals called foraminifera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Over the bottom of the sea, therefore, great beds of sand and
mud, mingled with the remains of plants and animals, are
always accumulating. If now this bottom could be raised up
above the sea level, even though the sand and mud should get
as dry and hard as any rock among the hills, you would be
able to say with certainty that they had once been under the
sea, because you would find in them the shells and other remains
of marine animals. This raising of the sea bottom has often
taken place in ancient times. You will find most of the rocks
of our hills and valleys to have been originally laid down in
the sea, where they were formed out of sand and mud dropped
on the sea floor, just as sand and mud are carried out to sea
and laid down there now. And in these rocks, not merely near
the shore, but far inland, in quarries or ravines, or the sides and
even the tops of the hills, you will be able to pick out the skeletons
and fragments of the various sea creatures which were
living in the old seas.</p>

<p>Since the bottom of the sea forms the great receptacle into
which the mouldered remains of the surface of the land are
continually carried, it is plain that if this state of things were
to go on without modification or hindrance, in the end the whole
of the solid land would be worn away, and its remains would
be spread out on the sea floor, leaving one vast ocean to roll
round the globe.</p>

<p>But there is in nature another force which here comes into
play to retard the destruction of the land.</p>

<h3>THE INSIDE OF THE EARTH.</h3>

<p>It may seem at first as if it were hopeless that man should
ever know anything about the earth’s interior. Just think what
a huge ball this globe of ours is, and you will see that after all,
in living and moving over its surface, we are merely like flies
walking over a great hill. All that can be seen from the top of
the highest mountain to the bottom of the deepest mine is not
more in comparison than the mere varnish on the outside of a
school globe. And yet a good deal can be learnt as to what
takes place within the earth. Here and there, in different countries,
there are places where communication exists between the
interior and the surface; and it is from such places that much
of our information on this subject is derived. Volcanoes are
among the most important of the channels of communication
with the interior.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that you were to visit one of these volcanoes
just before what is called “an eruption.” As you approach it,
you see a conical mountain, seemingly with its top cut off.
From this truncated summit a white cloud rises. But it is not
quite such a cloud as you would see on a hill top in this country.
For as you watch it you notice that it rises out of the top
of the mountain, even though there are no clouds to be seen
anywhere else. Ascending from the vegetation of the lower
grounds, you find the slopes to consist partly of loose stones
and ashes, partly of rough black sheets of rock, like the slags
of an iron furnace. As you get nearer the top the ground feels
hot, and puffs of steam, together with stifling vapors, come out
of it here and there. At last you reach the summit, and there
what seemed a level top is seen to be in reality a great basin,
with steep walls descending into the depths of the mountain.
Screening your face as well as possible from the hot
gases which almost choke you, you creep to the top of this
basin, and look down into it. Far below, at the base of the
rough red and yellow cliffs which form its sides, lies a pool of
some liquid, glowing with a white heat, though covered for the
most part with a black crust like that seen on the outside of the
mountain during the ascent. From this fiery pool jets of the
red hot liquid are jerked out every now and then, stones and
dust are cast up into the air, and fall back again, and clouds of
steam ascend from the same source and form the uprising cloud
which is seen from a great distance hanging over the mountain.</p>

<p>This caldron-shaped hollow on the summit of the mountain
is the crater. The intensely heated liquid in the sputtering
boiling pool at its bottom is melted rock or lava. And
the fragmentary materials—ashes, dust, cinders, and stones—thrown
out, are torn from the hardened sides and bottom of the
crater by the violence of the explosions with which the gases
and steam escape.</p>

<p>The hot air and steam, and the melted mass at the bottom of
the crater, show that there must be some source of intense heat
underneath. And as the heat has been coming out for hundreds,
or even thousands of years, it must exist there in great
abundance.</p>

<p>But it is when the volcano appears in active eruption that the
power of this underground heat shows itself most markedly.
For a day or two beforehand, the ground around the mountain
trembles. At length, in a series of violent explosions, the heart
of the volcano is torn open, and perhaps its upper part is blown
into the air. Huge clouds of steam roll away up into the air,
mingled with fine dust and red hot stones. The heavier stones
fall back again into the crater or on the outer slopes of the
mountain, but the finer ashes come out in such quantity, as
sometimes to darken the sky for many miles round, and to settle
down over the surrounding country as a thick covering.
Streams of white hot molten lava run down the outside of the
mountain, and descend even to the gardens and houses at the
base, burning up or overflowing whatever lies in their path.
This state of matters continues for days or weeks, until the volcano
exhausts itself, and then a time of comparative quiet
comes, when only steam, hot vapors, and gases are given off.</p>

<p>About 1800 years ago, there was a mountain near Naples
shaped like a volcano, and with a large crater covered with
brushwood. No one had ever seen any steam, or ashes, or lava
come from it, and the people did not imagine it to be a volcano,
like some other mountains in that part of Europe. They had
built villages and towns around its base, and their district, from
its beauty and soft climate, used to attract wealthy Romans to
build villas there. But at last, after hardly any warning, the
whole of the higher part of the mountain was blown into the
air with terrific explosions. Such showers of fine ashes fell for
miles around, that the sky was as dark as midnight. Day and
night the ashes and stones descended on the surrounding country;
many of the inhabitants were killed, either by stones falling
on them, or from suffocation by the dust. When at last the
eruption ceased, the district, which had before drawn visitors
from all parts of the old world, was found to be a mere desert
of grey dust and stone. Towns and villages, vineyards and
gardens, were all buried. Of the towns, the two most noted
were called Herculaneum and Pompeii. So completely did
they disappear, that, although important places at the time,
their very sites were forgotten, and only by accident, after the
lapse of some fifteen hundred years, were they discovered.
Excavations have since that time been carried on, the hardened
volcanic accumulations have been removed from the
old city, and you can now walk through the streets of Pompeii
again, with their roofless dwelling houses and shops, theaters
and temples, and mark on the causeway the deep ruts
worn by the carriage wheels of the Pompeians eighteen centuries
ago. Beyond the walls of the now silent city rises Mount
Vesuvius, with its smoking crater, covering one half of the old
mountain which was blown up when Pompeii disappeared.</p>

<p>Volcanoes, then, mark the position of some of the holes or
orifices, whereby heated materials from the inside of the earth
are thrown up to the surface. They occur in all quarters of the
globe. In Europe, beside Mount Vesuvius, which has been
more or less active since it was formed, Etna, Stromboli, and
other smaller volcanoes, occur in the basin of the Mediterranean,
while far to the northwest some volcanoes rise amid the
snows and glaciers of Iceland. In America a chain of
huge volcanoes stretches down the range of mountains which
rises from the western margin of the continent. In Asia they
are thickly grouped together in Java and some of the surrounding
islands, and stretch thence through Japan and the Aleutian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Isles, to the extremity of North America. If you trace this
distribution upon the map, you will see that the Pacific Ocean
is girded all round with volcanoes.</p>

<p>Since these openings into the interior of the earth are so
numerous over the surface, we may conclude that this interior
is intensely hot. But we have other proofs of this internal heat.
In many countries hot springs rise to the surface. Even in
England, which is a long way from any active volcano, the
water of the wells of Bath is quite warm (120° Fahr.). It is
known, too, that in all countries the heat increases as we
descend into the earth. The deeper a mine the warmer are the
rocks and air at its bottom. If the heat continues to increase
in the same proportion, the rocks must be red hot at no great
distance beneath us.</p>

<p>It is not merely by volcanoes and hot springs, however, that
the internal heat of the earth affects the surface. The solid
ground is made to tremble, or is rent asunder, or is upheaved
or let down. You have probably heard or read of earthquakes;
those shakings of the ground, which, when they are at their
worst, crack the ground open, throw down trees and buildings,
and bury hundreds or thousands of people in the ruins. Earthquakes
are most common in or near those countries where
active volcanoes exist. They frequently take place just before
a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>Some parts of the land are slowly rising out of the sea; rocks,
which used always to be covered by the tides, come to be wholly
beyond their limits; while others, which used never to be seen
at all, begin one by one to show their heads above water. On
the other hand some tracts are slowly sinking; piers, sea walls,
and other old landmarks on the beach, are one after another
enveloped by the sea as it encroaches further and higher on
the land. These movements, whether in an upward or downward
direction, are likewise due in some way to the internal
heat.</p>

<p>Now when you reflect upon these various changes you will
see that through the agency of this same internal heat land is
preserved upon the face of the earth. If rain and frost, rivers,
glaciers, and the sea were to go on wearing down the surface of
the land continually, without any counterbalancing kind of
action, the land would necessarily in the end disappear, and
indeed would have disappeared long ago. But owing to the
pushing out of some parts of the earth’s surface by the movements
of the heated materials inside, portions of the land are
raised to a higher level, while parts of the bed of the sea are
actually upheaved so as to form land.</p>

<p>This kind of elevation has happened many times in all quarters
of the globe. As already mentioned most of our hills and
valleys are formed of rocks, which were originally laid down
on the bottom of the sea, and have been subsequently raised
into land.</p>

<p>This earth of ours is the scene of continual movement and
change. The atmosphere which encircles it is continually in
motion, diffusing heat, light, and vapor. From the sea and
from the waters of the land, vapor is constantly passing into
the air, whence, condensed into clouds, rain and snow, it
descends again to the earth. All over the surface of the land
the water which falls from the sky courses seaward in brooks
and rivers, bearing into the great deep the materials which are
worn away from the land. Water is thus ceaselessly circulating
between the air, the land, and the sea. The sea, too, is
never at rest. Its waves gnaw the edges of the land, and its
currents sweep round the globe. Into its depths the spoils of
the land are borne, there to gather into rocks, out of which new
islands and continents will eventually be formed. Lastly, inside
the earth is lodged a vast store of heat by which the surface is
shaken, rent open, upraised or depressed. Thus, while old
land is submerged beneath the sea, new tracts are upheaved, to
be clothed with vegetation and peopled with animals, and to
form a fitting abode for man himself.</p>

<p>This world is not a living being, like a plant or an animal,
and yet you must now see that there is a sense in which we may
speak of it as such. The circulation of air and water, the interchange
of sea and land; in short the system of endless and
continual movement by which the face of the globe is day by
day altered and renewed, may well be called the Life of the
Earth.</p>

<h3 id="FEB3">AM I NOT IN SPORT?<br />
<span class="smaller">By JAMES WALKER, D.D., LL.D.<br />
[<i>February 3.</i>]</span></h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, so is the
man who deceiveth his neighbor, and saith, ‘Am I not in sport?’”
Proverbs xxvi, 18:19.</p>

</div>

<p>It is incalculable how much pain is inflicted, and how much
injury is done, without anything which can properly be called
malicious intent, or deliberate wrong. Thus there are those
who, like the madman mentioned in Scripture, will cast firebrands,
arrows, and death, and then think it a sufficient excuse
to say, “Are we not in sport?” Let it be that they <i>are</i>; I think
it will not be difficult to show that this will not excuse, or
do much to palliate, the conduct in question. I think it will not
be difficult to show that men are answerable for the mischiefs
they do from mere wantonness or in sport, and that it is wrong-doing
of this description which makes up no inconsiderable
part of every one’s guilt.</p>

<p>It is to little or no purpose to be able to say that such offences
do not originate in conscious malice, for, as has just been intimated,
the same is true of a large proportion of acknowledged
crimes. It is seldom, very seldom, that men injure one another
from hatred, or for the sake of revenge—because they find, or
expect to find, any pleasure in the mere consciousness of inflicting
pain. Men injure one another from wantonness, or want
of consideration; or, more commonly still, because the carrying
out of their policy, or their prejudices, or their sport, happens
to interfere with the interests and comfort of others, and,
though really sorry for this, they are not prepared to give up
either their policy or their prejudices, or their sport to spare
another’s feelings. Wars are waged and conquests made,
mourning and desolation spread through a whole country,
in the wantonness of honor, or to gratify an insatiable
ambition; but without anything which can properly be called
malice, either in the first movers or immediate agents. Men
opposed to each other in politics or religion will allow this opposition
to go to very unjustifiable lengths, even to the disturbing
of the peace of neighborhoods, and the breaking of friendships
and family connections; and all this, to be sure, must give rise
to a great deal of ill-will and hot blood; but it does not originate
in malice, properly so called—in positive malice toward
anybody. Likewise a rash and improvident man may bring
incalculable mischief on all connected with him, involving
them in pecuniary difficulties, or committing and paining them
in other ways, and yet be able to allege with perfect truth that
he did not mean to do them any harm; that, so far from being
actuated by malice, he feels nothing and has felt nothing but
the sincerest affection for the very persons whom he has injured,
and most affection, perhaps, for those whom he has most
injured. But why multiply illustrations? The whole catalogue
of the vices of self-indulgence and excess—black and comprehensive
as it is—has nothing to do with malicious intent; that
is to say, these vices do not find any part of their temptation
or gratification in ill-will to others, or in the consciousness of
causing misery to others. And yet who, on this account,
denies that they are vices, or that they are among the worst of
vices?</p>

<p>The moral perplexity existing in some minds on this subject
may be traced to two errors: making malice to be the <i>only</i> bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
motive by which we can be actuated, and confounding the
mere <i>absence of malice</i> with that active principle of benevolence,
or love of our neighbor, which Christianity makes to be
the foundation and substance of all true social virtue.</p>

<p>How unfounded the first of these assumptions is, appears
generally from what has been said; but the same may also be
shown on strictly ethical grounds. We must distinguish
between what is simply <i>odious</i>, and what is immoral. The
malignant passions when acted out by animals are odious, but
they are not immoral, because they are not comprehended in
that light by the agent. The reason why the malignant passions
are immoral in man is that he knows them to be immoral;
and accordingly any other passion, which he knows to be
immoral, becomes for the same reason alike immoral to him as
a principle of conduct. Hence it follows that, though not actuated
by malice, we may be by some other motive equally reprehensible
in a moral point of view, though not perhaps as
odious—by the love of ease, by vanity or pride, by unjust partialities,
by inordinate ambition, by avarice or lust—dispositions
which have nothing to do with malice, but yet are felt and
acknowledged by all to be bad and immoral.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="FEB10">[<i>February 10.</i>]</h3>

<p>Moreover, the tendencies of modern civilization are to be considered
in this connection. Times of violence are gradually giving
place to times of self-indulgence and fraud; and the consequence
is that now, where one man is betrayed into vices of malevolence
and outrage, twenty are betrayed into those of frivolity, licentiousness,
or overreaching. I go further still. Suppose a man
actuated by none of these positively bad motives; nay, suppose
the injury done to be accidental and wholly unintentional,
this will not in all cases justify the deed. The question still
arises whether the injury done, supposing it to be wholly unintentional,
might not have been foreseen, and ought not to have
been foreseen; for, where the well-being of others is concerned,
we are bound not only to mean no harm, but to take
care to avoid everything which is likely to do harm; and negligence
in this respect is itself a crime. So obviously just is
this principle, so entirely does it approve itself to the reason
and common sense of mankind, that we find it everywhere
recognized, in some form or other, in the jurisprudence of civilized
countries. “When a workman flings down a stone or
piece of timber into the street, and kills a man, this may be
either misadventure, manslaughter, or murder, according to
the circumstances under which the original act is done. If it
were in a country village, where a few passengers are, and he
calls out to all people to have a care, it is misadventure only;
but if it were in London, or other populous town, where people
are continually passing, it is manslaughter, though he gives loud
warning; and murder, if he knows of their passing and gives
no warning at all, for then it is malice against all mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Equally groundless is the second of the above mentioned
assumptions, to wit: that of confounding the mere <i>absence of
malice</i> with the active principle of benevolence itself or that
love of our neighbor which Christianity makes to be the foundation
and substance of all true social virtue. There is nothing,
perhaps, which more essentially distinguishes worldly propriety
and legal honesty from Christian virtue than this, that
they stop with negatives. They are content with avoiding what
is expressly forbidden, not reflecting that this, at the best, only
makes men to be <i>not bad</i>; it does not make them to be good.
Besides, if we take this ground, if we allege the absence of all
anger and resentment, we bar the plea that we were hurried
into the act by the impetuosity of our passions—a plea which
the experience of a common infirmity has always led men to
regard as the strongest extenuating circumstance of wrong-doing.
If we have given pain to a fellow creature, it is stating
an aggravation of the fault and not an excuse, to say that we
did not do it in passion, but in cold blood; and worse still, if
we say that we did it in sport. What! find sport in giving pain
to others? This may consist, I suppose, with the absence of
what is commonly understood by malice; but I utterly deny its
compatibility with active Christian benevolence, or with what
indeed amounts to the same thing, a kind, generous, and magnanimous
nature. Were I in quest of facts to prove the total
depravity of man, I should eagerly seize on such as the following:
The shouts of heartless merriment sometimes heard to
arise from a crowd of idlers collected around a miserable object
in the streets; a propensity to turn into ridicule, not merely the
faults and affectations of others, but their natural deformities
or defects; jesting with sacred things, or practical jests, the
consequences of which to one of the parties are of the most
serious and painful character; and the pleasure with which
men listen to sarcastic remarks though causeless and unprovoked,
or to wit the whole point of which consists in its sting.
Not that the doctrine of universal and total depravity is actually
proved even by such conduct, for happily the conduct
itself is not universal; to some it is repugnant from the beginning;
and besides, even where it is fallen into, I suppose it is
to be referred in a majority of cases to a love of excitement,
rather than to a love of evil for its own sake. Still I maintain
that the conduct in question, however explained, is incompatible,
or at any rate utterly inconsistent, with thoughtful and
generous natures.</p>

<h3 id="FEB17">[<i>February 17.</i>]</h3>

<p>Still, many who would not think entirely to excuse the conduct
in question can find palliations for it and extenuating circumstances,
some of which it will be well to examine.</p>

<p>In the first place it is said that the sport is not found in the
sufferings of the victim, but in the awkward and ludicrous situations
and embarrassments into which he is thrown. Now I
admit, that, if these awkwardnesses and absurdities could be
entirely disconnected with the idea of pain, they might amuse
even a good mind; but as they can not be thus disconnected—as
all this is known and seen to be the expression of anguish
either of body or mind, or to be the consequence of some natural
defect or misfortune, or some cruel imposition on weakness
or good nature—I affirm as before, that he whose mirth is
not checked by this single consideration betrays a want of true
benevolence, and even of common humanity. Neither will it
help the matter much to say that the pain and mortification are
not known, are not seen, or at least <i>are not attended</i> to; that
this view of the subject is entirely overlooked, the mind being
wholly taken up with its ludicrous aspects. For how comes it
that we have so quick a sense to everything ludicrous in the
situation and conduct of others, but no sense at all to their sufferings?
Our hearts, it would seem, are not as yet steeled
against all sympathy in the sufferings and misfortunes of our
neighbors, provided we can be made to apprehend and realize
them; and this is well; but why <i>so slow</i> to apprehend and realize
them? If, though directly before our eyes, the thought of
them never occurs to our minds; if we can say, and say with
truth, that while we enjoy the sport it never once occurred to us
that it was at the expense of another’s feelings, though this fact
was all the time staring us in the face—does it not at least betray
a degree of indifference or carelessness about the feelings
of others, which is only compatible with a cold and selfish temper?
Put whatever construction you will, therefore, on this
kind of sport, it argues a bad state of the affections; for either
its connection with the pain and mortification of others is perceived,
and then it is downright cruelty; or it is not perceived,
and then it is downright insensibility.</p>

<p>Another ground is sometimes taken. There are those who
will say, “We cannot help it. Persons of a constitution less
susceptible to the ludicrous, or less quick to observe it, may do
differently, but we cannot.” Obviously, however, reasonings
of this sort, if intended as a valid excuse, betray a singular and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
almost hopeless confusion of moral ideas. They cannot help
it? Of course they do not mean that they would be affected in
the same way by the same thing, under all circumstances and
in all states of feeling. Let the coarse jest be at the expense of
a parent, or of a sister; or let its tendency be to bring derision
on an office, a cause, or a doctrine which we have much at
heart; or let it offend beyond a certain point against the conventional
usages of what is called good society—and, instead
of provoking mirth, it provokes indignation or contempt. All
they can mean, therefore, is simply this: Their sense of the
ludicrous is so keen, that, when not restrained by some present
feeling of justice, humanity, or decorum, it becomes irrepressible.
Undoubtedly it does; but this is no more than what
might be said of the worst crimes of sensuality and excess.
What would you think if a sordid man should plead, that being
sordid by nature, and not having any high principle or feeling
to restrain him, he cannot help acting sordidly? Does he not
know that it is this want of high principle and feeling which
constitutes the very essence of his sin? We have shown that to
find sport in what gives pain, argues a bad state of the principles
and affections. Manifestly, therefore, it is to no purpose
to urge as an excuse, that in the existing state of our principles
and affections we can not help it; for the existing state of our
principles and affections is the very thing which is complained
of and condemned.</p>

<p>It may be contended, as a last resort, that this state of mind
is consistent, to say the least, with amiable manners, companionable
qualities, and good nature. But if herein is meant to
be included real kindness of heart, or the highest forms of generosity
and nobleness of soul, I deny that it can be. There is
no necessity of trying to make it out that men of this stamp are
worse than they really are. Unquestionably they can and often
do make themselves agreeable and entertaining, especially to
those who are not very scrupulous about the occasions of their
mirth, and feel no repugnance to join in a laugh which perhaps
they would hesitate to raise. Good-natured also they may be,
if nothing more is meant by this than the absence of an unaccommodating,
morose, and churlish disposition; for there are
two sorts of good nature, the good nature of benevolence, and
the good nature of ease and indifference. The first will not
consist, as we have seen, with wrong-doing from wantonness
or in sport; but the last may; yet even when it does, not much
credit can accrue from this circumstance. Worthy of all honor
is that good nature which springs from genuine kindness and
sympathy, or a desire to make and to see everybody happy;
but the same can hardly be said of what often passes for good-nature
in the world, though it is nothing but the result of an
easy temper and loose principles.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="FEB24">[<i>February 24.</i>]</h3>

<p>Still, I can not but think that a large majority of those who
sometimes look for sport in wrong-doing have enough of humanity
and of justice to restrain them, if they could only be
made to understand and feel the extent of the injury thus occasioned.
Take, for example, jesting with sacred things. Its
influence on those who indulge in it is worse than that of infidelity,
for it destroys our reverence, and it is harder to recover
our reverence, after it has been lost, than our convictions.
Nay, it is often worse than that of daring crime; the latter puts
us in opposition to religion, but it does not necessarily undermine
our respect for it, or the sentiment on which the whole
rests. Consider, too, its effect on others. The multitude are
apt to mistake what is laughed at by their superiors for what
is ridiculous in itself. In France it was not the sober arguments
of a knot of misguided atheists, but the scoffs and mockeries
and ill-timed pleasantries in which the higher classes generally
shared, which destroyed the popular sense of the sanctity
of religion; and when this great regulative principle of
society was gone, it was not long before the mischief came
back, amidst scenes of popular license and desperation, “to
plague the inventors.” And so of cruel sports. In reading the
Sermon on the Mount, you must have been struck with the fact
that, while he who is angry with his brother is only said to be
in danger of the judgment, “whosoever shall say, thou fool, shall
be in danger of hell fire.” But, on second thoughts, is this
anything more than a simple recognition of what we all know
to be true; that hatred does not inflict half so deep or bitter a
feeling of wrong as scorn? Much is said about the disorganizing
doctrines and theories of the day, but, bad as these are,
they are not likely to do so much to exasperate the poor against
the rich, and break down the bulwarks of order and law, as
the conduct of some among the rich themselves. The time was
when the few could trample with indifference on the interests
and feelings of the many, and make sport of their complaints
with impunity, but that time has passed away.</p>

<p>One word also on those cruel sports where animals, and not
men, are the sufferers. Cruelty to animals is essentially the
same feeling with cruelty to a fellow-creature, and in some respects
it is even more unbecoming. Man is as a god to the
inferior races. To abuse the power which this gives us over
the helpless beings that Providence has placed at our mercy, is
as mean as it is inhuman. If we would listen to the pleadings
of what is noble and generous in our natures, it would be as
impossible for us needlessly to harm an unoffending animal,
as it would be to strike an infant or an idiot. Shame on the
craven who quails before his equals, and then goes away and
wreaks his unmanly resentments on a creature which he knows
can neither retaliate nor speak! Besides, we may suppose that
there are orders of beings above us, as well as below us. Look
then at our treatment of the lower animals, and then ask yourselves
what we should think, if a superior order of beings
should mete out to us the same measure. What if in mere wantonness,
or to pamper unnatural tastes, they should subject us
to every imaginable hardship and wrong? What if they should
make a show, a public recreation, of our foolish contests and
dying agonies? Nay, more; what if it should come to this,
that in their language a man-killer should be called a <i>sportsman</i>
by way of distinction?</p>

<p>But I must close. We have it on the authority of the Bible, and
we read it in the constitution of man, that there is “a time to
weep and a time to laugh.” There will also be ample scope
for the legitimate action of caustic wit, so long as there are follies
to be shown up, pretenders to be unmasked, and conceit and
affectation to be taught to know themselves. But, in the serious
strifes of the world, the ultimate advantages of this weapon,
though wielded on the right side, are more than dubious.
“The Spaniards have lamented,” it has been said, “and I believe
truly, that Cervantes’ just and inimitable ridicule of
knight-errantry rooted up, with that folly, a great deal of their
real honor. And it was apparent that Butler’s fine satire on
fanaticism contributed not a little, during the licentious times
of Charles II., to bring sober piety into disrepute. The reason
is evident; there are many lines of resemblance between truth
and its counterfeits; and it is the province of wit only to find
out the likenesses in things, and not the talent of the common
admirers of it to discover the differences.” At any rate we can
shun the rock of small wits who think to make up for poverty
of invention by a scurrility and grimace, who think to gain
from the venom of the shaft what is wanting in the vigor of the
bow. We can imitate the example of those among the great
masters of wit in all ages, who have ennobled it by purity of
expression and a moral aim; so that, in the end, virtue may
not have occasion to blush, or humanity to mourn, for anything
we have said or done. Take any other course and we
are reminded of the confession which experience wrung from
the lips of the wise man: “I said in my heart, go to now, I
will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure; and behold
this also is vanity. I said of laughter, it is mad; and of
mirth, what doeth it?” “Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful,
and the end of that mirth is heaviness.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">EDWARD C. REYNOLDS, Esq.</span></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>I.—LAW IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p>It perhaps would be well for us to take a glance at the origin
of the law which we are about to consider in its practical applications.
In all our business relations, and in fact in our general
conduct, so far as that term would apply to one as a member of
a community and a citizen, we are controlled in our action by
absolute, and in some instances possibly, by arbitrary regulations
or laws, with which perhaps we may be wholly unfamiliar,
but which are none the less binding and positive in their exactions
because we have neglected to familiarize ourselves with
their requirements.</p>

<p>It is a rule of law, that ignorance of it excuses no one. For
this reason ignorance is never pleaded in court as an answer to
civil or criminal allegations of any sort. This rule presupposes
a knowledge of the law on the part of every citizen. While,
strictly speaking, this is impossible and in reality but a fiction,
any other provision would be fraught with danger. Although,
through the observance of this rule, doubtless, hardships are
occasioned—as in fact must result from the enforcement of any
law, however wise—it is notwithstanding that, a very necessary
and strictly proper presumption. Were it to be otherwise, any
attempt to enforce obligations against dishonest parties or to
punish crime would prove ineffectual, because recourse would
always be had to this defense. Thus all law would be a
nullity.</p>

<p>There is fortunately a safe rule to be adopted as a guide for
our conduct, which in the main, if strictly obeyed, will obviate
the seeming hardship. Notwithstanding the fact that all inhibitions
do not involve an absolute wrong or right, that all enforcements
of law are not with justice, yet if a strict standard
of right and honorable dealings characterize individual action
and conduct, for those who adopt such a course there is but
slight possibility that there is any especial oppression in store.</p>

<p>But wrong doing exists. The remedy is existing law. What
is it, which as such we are to obey, and which we may safely
designate as the principle of personal protection?</p>

<p>The nucleus of the now voluminous laws of our country was
the well established laws, customs and usages of the American
colonies of Great Britain, when their independence was secured.
At that time the laws of Great Britain had become so
generally interwoven into our judicature as well as into our
business customs and relations, that the introduction of a wholly
new system of laws would have proved disastrous, even if it
could have been accomplished.</p>

<p>Since, in part, law is the outgrowth of customs and ways, as
we shall see, to have attempted the engrafting of a wholly new
system would have been equivalent to an attempt to change at
once the habits and characteristics of a people.</p>

<p>The familiarity of the colonists with the then existing law,
and its adaptability to the then commercial transactions, made
it a desirable nucleus—already for our people, with which they
might inaugurate a system of their own.</p>

<p>This, then, was accepted as the common law of the country
at that time. But however well adapted the then existing laws
may have been to the wants of the people and commerce, ever
changing conditions of life and ever increasing business complications
rendered additions and new provisions necessary.
These changes were made necessary and were fostered by
statute law.</p>

<p>Statute law is the result of the deliberations of legislative assemblies.
Each state has its own legislature and statute law,
as has the national government. The general government
being the superior power, its laws must be recognized as superior
to state laws, that is, there can be no state law inconsistent
with the laws of the national government. The state legislatures
and national congress have power to make laws, and
whatever is declared by these bodies to be the supreme law of
the land, for the government of the individual and the protection
of property, providing it does not conflict with the provisions
of the national and state constitutions respectively, must
be obeyed as such.</p>

<p>This then is statute law: An enactment regarding the rights
of persons or property, passed by representatives of the people
in legislature assembled.</p>

<p>When a question has arisen concerning which statute law
has no provisions, or some regular enactment is so worded that
its meaning is doubtful and extremely liable to be misunderstood,
to compensate for the lack in the one instance and to
interpret properly the intention of the law makers in the other,
we resort to the common law, fairly said to be “the accumulated
wisdom of centuries.” Analogy will lead us to conclude,
and correctly, that this is the conservative element of the system—the
origin of which we have previously alluded to in part—to
which we would add the customs and usages which have,
since our recognition as an independent people, received the
sanction of our courts, and to become acquainted with which
reference must be made to the published reports of the courts,
known as the “U. S. Reports,” “Maine Reports,” etc.</p>

<p>That the common law may remain to a great extent unchangeable,
much respect is paid to the decisions of the courts,
by others than those by which they were enunciated, for it has
ever been deemed better that a precedent be respected, even
if it be not the soundest law, than to have what might seem to
be better logic at the expense of a varying precedent. Then
we conclude, that though legislatures be radical in the change
of existing laws, yet in the task of applying or interpreting
such laws, so changed, courts are generally very conservative.
It will thus be seen that the rights of the people are not liable
to be unwarrantably abridged or destroyed by any uncertain
movement of a day.</p>

<p>By referring to our national and state constitutions, our
readers will see that the powers of both national and state governments
are divided into three departments, known as the
executive, legislative and judicial, each of which is distinct from
the others, although they work in harmony in the enactment
and enforcement of the laws. The courts come under the head
of that last named, and their duties have been demonstrated to
be “to define, declare and apply the laws.”</p>

<p>Of this common and statute law a very essential part is that
which is applicable to business, or commercial law, or, as it is
generally denominated in the books, the “Law-Merchant.”
Much of the law bearing upon this subject is the old common
law, with the enlargements consequent upon an increased
commercial activity. Here it is that we find many of the customs
and usages of merchants gradually merging into recognized
law. The three “days of grace” allowed on all commercial
paper is but a common illustration of this, similar in
origin to many customs in all departments of trade, which
might easily be cited, and which were in their inception of very
limited significance, but which have continually been receiving
a more extended recognition, until we find them clothed with
all the insignia of authority.</p>

<p>These customs and usages we shall have occasion to give
more extended explanations as we touch upon the several sub-divisions
of our topic. There are a few technical words which
we shall find it convenient to use. Prof. Greenleaf clearly expresses
the reason for this, as follows:</p>

<p>“A great deal of the language of every art or science or profession
is technical (indeed, technical means belonging to some
art), and is peculiar to it, and may not be understood by those
who do not pursue the business to which it belongs. This is as
true of the law as of everything else.… A good instance
of this is in those words which end in <i>er</i> (or <i>or</i>) and in <i>ee</i>. As
for example, promisor or promisee, vendor and vendee, indorser
and indorsee. These terminations are derived from the
Norman-French, which was for a long time the language of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
courts and of the law of England. And it might seem that we
had just as good terminations in English, in <i>er</i> and <i>ed</i>, which
mean the same thing. But this is not so. Originally they
meant the same thing, but they do not now, for both <i>er</i> and <i>ee</i>
are applied, in law, to persons, and <i>ed</i> to things, so that we
want all three terminations. For example, indorser means the
man who indorses; indorsee the man to whom the indorsement
is made; but the note itself we say is indorsed. So vendor
means the man who sells, vendee the man to whom something
is sold, and the thing sold is vended.”</p>

<p>In regard to the phrase “presumption of law,” to which we
may have occasion to refer. The significance of this phrase is
this: Under certain conditions, without absolute proof of the
matter concerning which some conclusion is sought, the law
will presume to interpret the intention or acts of persons. For
instance, regarding criminal procedure, one is presumed to
be innocent until he is proved to be guilty. Presumptions prevail
only when proof is lacking.</p>

<h3>CONTRACTS.</h3>

<p>A contract has been aptly defined to be “an agreement to do
or not to do some particular thing.” It may be verbal or in
writing. If the conditions of a contract, whether verbal or
written, be expressly stated and agreed upon, it is then termed
an expressed contract. If on the other hand there are no well
defined and specific agreements regarding the undertaking or
the consideration to be paid for its accomplishment, it is called
an implied contract.</p>

<p>The conditions of an expressed contract must be strictly
complied with, and the parties to it are bound to faithfully observe
the same, however onerous may be the burden, while the
conditions of an implied contract not being agreed upon specifically,
are such as custom may dictate. As an illustration of
this: A agrees to pay B two dollars per day for labor. This is
expressed, so far as the rate of wages is concerned; but the
number of hours that shall be taken to constitute a day’s work
is not agreed upon, and must be determined by implication.
As a result, the question would be settled by the custom in such
matters which obtained in the place where the contract was
made. Or, if A engages B to undertake the building of a cottage,
with no stipulations regarding the wages to be paid, B
when the work is completed can recover for his compensation
whatever is proved to be the usual and customary remuneration
paid men in the same business and possessed of equal skill.
The enforcement of obligations is no less strict when the standing
of the contract is implied than when expressed, after determining
what the obligations of the parties are.</p>

<p>The elements of a contract are parties, consideration, subject
matter, mutual assent and time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parties.</span>—Two or more competent persons may make a
legal contract. Competent persons, it will be observed. What
constitutes competency? Generally, legal age and sound
mind; while minority, insanity, idiocy, intoxication and coverture
are said to be the conditions of incompetency. With the
exception of a few states where females become of age at eighteen,
the legal age is twenty-one years. A consideration of the
conditions of incompetency will sufficiently explain the requisites
of competency negatively. Minors, or those who have
not attained legal age, or infants as the law denominates them,
are considered incompetent because of inexperience, and a fair
presumption that unprincipled parties might take unfair advantage
of them, and lead them into business complications
which a riper experience would disapprove. The contracts of
a minor approved by him when he becomes of age are binding,
however; so that it will be observed, such contracts are not
absolutely void, only voidable at the discretion of the minor.
If an infant makes a transfer of real estate he may, on reaching
his majority, compel the purchaser to reconvey the property, by
returning to him the purchase money. The law would not
permit him to retain the purchase price and compel the re-transfer,
because it is not the policy of the law to assist the
minor in his fraudulent purposes, but only to protect him from
the impositions of those skilled in wicked devices. There are
some contracts which an infant can not disclaim, viz.: such as
are for necessaries. It is something of a question to determine
what are necessaries; but the minor’s fortune and social position
must be the guide, for where sufficient food and clothes
might be all that would be termed necessaries for one, for another
by fortune more favored, “equipage, dress and entertainments”
would be considered just as essential.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unsound Mind.</span>—Insanity, or a mind deranged; idiocy, or
the lack of a mind; intoxication, or a mind so beclouded as to
be incapable of understandingly judging of the merits of an
ordinary business transaction; a mind in any one of these
conditions is unsound, and its possessor an incompetent.</p>

<p>Coverture, or marriage, by the common law made woman an
incompetent party, and she was thus precluded from legally
contracting. By statutory enactments nearly all of the states
have changed this, so that a married woman may now do business,
contract debts as though unmarried, and also hold property
in her own right. The ancient barbarous theory that marriage
ought to annul a woman’s right to property in her own
name and almost deny her individual existence is nearly a
relic, an error almost of the past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Consideration.</span>—Any consideration is sufficient to sustain
a contract, provided it be not illegal, or that which is prohibited
by law; immoral, or that which contravenes the moral law;
and provided the contract was born of good faith, and not
tainted by fraud. A contract into which any element of fraud
has entered receives no countenance at the law. However
favorable stipulations may seem, a fraudulent intent, proved,
will nullify the contract.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Subject Matter</span>, or that concerning which the contract
is made must not be illegal, immoral or impossible. The
reasons for this are apparent, since it would controvert the
very object of legal rights and public policy if an illegal or immoral
undertaking were permitted to enter into a contract as a
thing to be done and as a recognized right to be enforced; or,
if a stipulation were permitted to stand, which called for the
doing of that which is impossible.</p>

<p>Mutual assent is an essential element. “It takes two to make
a trade.” There must be an agreement of minds between
contracting parties as to what is to be done, and how, and in
consideration of what; and this agreement must be at the same
time, or to state it in a legal fashion, “minds must meet.”</p>

<p>The time stated for the performance of a contract should be
agreed upon. In case it is not, then it must be accomplished
within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>What is a reasonable time must be determined by the special
circumstances of each individual case. It is with this as
with other elements of a contract if not fully understood and
agreed upon, the assistance of customs and usages must be
invoked to settle the disputed point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Statute of Frauds.</span>—This is an old English statute, adopted,
slightly modified, by the several states. It requires the following
contracts to be in writing: For the conveyance of real
estate; lease of land for more than one year; in consideration
of marriage; to answer for the debt, default or wrongful act of
another; not to be performed within one year; for the sale of
personal property of a certain value (by most states placed at
fifty dollars), unless the sale be by auction, or part of the purchase
money be paid, or part of the goods delivered at the time
of sale.</p>

<p>It is well that every man should be in a state of moral union
with others; he must have one or more men to whom he can
communicate the inmost feelings of his being, heart, and the
reasons of his conduct; there should be nothing in him which
is not known to some one else. That is the true meaning of
the divine saying, “It is not good that man should be alone.”—<i>Schleiermacher.</i></p>

<h3>GREEK ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>Greek architecture seems to have emerged from a state of
archaic simplicity in the sixth century before the Christian era.
All its finest creations were between that date and the death of
Alexander the Great in 333 B. C.</p>

<p>In the days of their greatest refinement the Greeks sought
rather to adorn their country than their homes. If there
were palatial residences, they were more perishable, and
have decayed or been destroyed, leaving few remains to tell of
their former grandeur. We know their architecture almost exclusively
from the ruins of their public buildings, and mostly
from temples and mausoleums. The Greek temple was peculiar,
and made little or no provision for a congregation of
worshipers. The design was largely for external effect. A
comparatively small room or cell received the image of the divinity,
and another room behind it seems to have served as a
treasury for votive offerings. But there were no surrounding
chambers, halls or court yards. The temple, though within
some precinct, was accessible to all, and, being open to the sun
and air, invited the admiration of the passer-by. Its most telling
features and best sculpture were on the exterior. The
columns and the superstructure which rested on them must
have played a very important part in their temple architecture.</p>

<p>There were in Greece three distinct manners, differing mostly
in the manner in which the column was treated. These are
called “orders;” and are named Doric, Ionic and Corinthian.
Each of these presents a different series of proportions, mouldings
and ornamentations in the column used, though the main
form of the structure is the same in all. The column and its entablature
being the most prominent features of the building, have
come to be regarded as the index or characteristic, from an
inspection of which the order can be recognized, just as a botanist
recognizes plants by their flowers.</p>

<p>From a study of the column all the principal characteristics
of the different orders are ascertained. The column belonging
to any order is, of course, always accompanied by the use
throughout the building of the appropriate proportions, mouldings
and ornaments belonging to that order.</p>

<p>The Doric temple at Corinth is attributed to the seventh century
B. C. This was a massive structure, with short, stumpy
columns, and strong mouldings, but presenting the main features
of the Doric style in its earliest, rudest form. The most
complete Greek Doric temple was the Parthenon—the work of the
architect Ictinus. It is selected for our purpose of illustration,
because on many accounts the best, and many of our readers
have seen the plate representing it. The Parthenon stood on
the summit of a lofty rock, within an irregularly shaped enclosure,
entered through a noble gateway. The temple itself
was of perfectly regular plan, and stood quite free from all
dependencies of any sort. It consisted of the <i>cella</i>, or sacred
cell, in which stood the statue of the goddess, and behind it the
treasury chamber. In both these there were symmetrical
columns. A series of columns surrounded the building, and at
either end was a portico eight columns wide and two deep.
There were two pediments of flat pitch, one at each end. The
whole rested on a basement of steps. The building, exclusive
of the steps, was 228 feet long by 101 feet wide, and 64 feet
high. The columns were 34 feet 3 inches high, and more than
6 feet in diameter at the base. The marble of which this temple
was constructed was of the most solid and durable kind,
and the workmanship in all the parts that remain shows great
skill and care in the execution. The roof was probably of
timbers covered with marble tiles; but all traces of the frame
work have entirely disappeared, and hence the mode of construction
is not known. Nor do authorities agree as to what
provision was made for the admission of light. It seems probable
that something like the clere-story of a Gothic church was
used to light the Parthenon.</p>

<p>This wonderful structure was Doric, and the leading proportions
were as follows: The column was 5.56 diameters high.
The whole height, including the stylobate or steps, might be
divided into nine parts, of which two go to the stylobate, six to
the column, and one to the entablature.</p>

<p>The Greek Doric order is without a base; the shaft of the
column springs from the top step, and is tapering, not in a
straight line, but with a subtle curve, known technically as the
entasis of the column. This shaft is channeled usually with
twenty shallow channels, the ridges separating one from another
being very fine lines.</p>

<p>The Parthenon, like many, if not all Greek buildings, was
profusely decorated with colored ornaments, of which nearly
every trace has now disappeared, but which must have contributed
largely to the beauty of the building as a whole, and
must have emphasized and set off its parts.</p>

<p>The most famous Greek building in the Ionic style was the
temple of Diana, at Ephesus. This magnificent temple was
almost totally destroyed, and the very site was, for centuries,
unknown, till the energy and sagacity of an English architect
enabled him to discover and dig out the vestiges of the building.
Fortunately sufficient traces of the foundation remained
to render it possible to make out the plan of the temple completely.
From the fragments he was able to restore on paper
the general appearance of the famous temple, which must be
very nearly, if not absolutely correct. The walls of this temple
were entirely surrounded by a double series of columns with a
pediment at each end. The whole was of marble and based
on a spacious platform of steps.</p>

<p>The Corinthian order, the last to make its appearance, was
almost as much Roman as Greek. It resembles the Ionic, but
the capitals are different, the columns more slender, and the
enrichments more florid.</p>

<p>The plan or floor disposition of a Greek building, always
simple, was well arranged for effect, and capable of being
understood at once. All confusion, uncertainty or complications
were scrupulously avoided. Refined precision, order,
symmetry and exactness mark the plan as well as every part of
the work.</p>

<p>The construction of the walls of Greek temples rivaled that
of the Egyptians in accuracy and beauty of workmanship;
though the wall was evidently not the principal thing for effect
with the Greek architect, as much of it was overshadowed by
lines of columns, which form the main feature of the building.</p>

<p>The Corinthian order is the natural sequel to the Ionic. Had
Greek architecture continued till it fell into decadence, this
order would have been its badge. As it was, the decadence
of Greek art was Roman art, and the Corinthian order was the
favorite order of the Romans.</p>

<p>The Etruscans, at an early day, inhabited the west coast of
Italy, between the rivers Arno and Tiber. At the time of the
founding of Rome as a city, they were a civilized people and
showed considerable architectural skill, and their arts had a
very great influence on Roman art. The remains of several
Etruscan towns show that their masonry was of what has been
called a Cyclopean character—that is, the stones were of an
enormous size. The massive blocks being fitted together with
consummate accuracy, much of the masonry endures to the
present day. The temples, palaces and dwelling houses which
made up the cities so fortified, have all disappeared, and the
only structural remains of Etruscan art are tombs—some cut
in live rock, and some detached structures. These built of
heavy stones and arched securely, still exist as monuments of
the science and skill of those early builders. They were
acquainted with and extensively used the true radiating arch,
composed of wedge-shaped stones. From them the Romans
learned to construct arches, and combined the arch with the
trabeated or lintel mode which they copied from the Greeks.
Hence arose a style distinctively Roman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The largest Etruscan temple of which any record remains
was that of Jupiter Capitolinus, at Rome, one of the most
splendid temples of antiquity.</p>

<p>The last of the classical styles of antiquity is the Roman.
This seems rather an amalgamation of several other styles than
an original, independent creation. It was formed slowly, and
is harmonious, though uniting elements widely dissimilar.</p>

<p>The Grecian artist was imaginative and idealistic in the
highest degree. He seemed to have an innate genius for art
and beauty, and was eager to perpetuate in marble his brightest
conceptions of excellence. The stern, practical Roman,
realistic in every pore, eager for conquest, was dominated by
the idea of bringing all nations under his sway, and of making
his city the capital of the world. At first he looked with disdain
on the fine arts, in all their forms, and regarded a love for
the beautiful, whether in literature or art, as an evidence of
effeminacy.</p>

<p>For nearly five hundred years there was very little architectural
taste displayed in the buildings at Rome. All public
works, as the Appian Way, bridges and aqueducts bore the
utilitarian stamp. Their best buildings were of brick or the
local stone, and there is little evidence that architecture was
studied as a fine art until about 150 B. C.</p>

<p>After the fall of Carthage, and the destruction of Corinth,
when Greece became a Roman province—both which events
occurred in the year 146 B. C.—Rome became desirous of emulating
the older civilization which she had destroyed. She
had, by her conquests, immense wealth, and expended much,
both privately and publicly, in erecting monuments, many of
which, more or less altered, remain to the present day.</p>

<p>The first marble temple in Rome was built by the consul Q.
Metellus Macedonicus, who died 115 B. C. From that period
Roman architecture showed a wonderful diversity in the objects
to which it was applied. Not only tombs, temples, and
palaces, but baths, theaters, and amphitheaters, basilicas, aqueducts
and triumphal arches were planned and built as elaborately
as the temples of the gods.</p>

<p>Under the emperors the architectural display reached its
full magnificence. The boast of Augustus, that he found Rome
of brick, and left her of marble, expresses in a few words the
great feature of his reign, and of that of several of the succeeding
emperors.</p>

<p>Though the most destructive of all agencies—hostile invasions,
conflagrations, and long ages of neglect—have done
their utmost to destroy all vestiges of Imperial Rome, there
still remain relics enough to make the city of the Cæsars, after
Athens, the richest store of classical architectural antiquities
in the world.</p>

<h3>BUILDINGS OF THE ROMANS.</h3>

<p>The temples in Rome were not, as in Greece and Egypt, the
structures on which the architect lavished all the resources of
his art and his science. They were, in a general way, copies
of Greek originals, and did not equal the models after which
they were fashioned, nor greatly honor the metropolis of the
world. Few remains of them exist. The Church of Santa
Maria Ezizica was once a heathen temple, and after some
necessary changes, used for Christian worship. This was tetrastyle,
with half columns around it, and of the kind called by
Vitruvius pseudo-peripteral. A few fragmentary remains of
other temples are found in Rome, but there are much finer
specimens in some of the provinces. The best is the Maison
Carrée at Nêmes. This was probably erected during the reign
of Hadrian. There is a portico in front, while the sides and
rear have columns attached. The details of the capitals and
entablature are almost pure Greek.</p>

<p>At Baalbec, the ancient Heliopolis in Syria, not far from
Damascus, are the ruins of another magnificent, provincial
Roman temple. It was built in the time of the Antonines, and
must have been of very extensive dimensions. At the western
end of an immense court, on an artificial elevation, stand the
remains of what is called the Great Temple. This was 290 feet
long by 160 feet wide, and had 54 columns supporting its roof,
only six of which now remain erect. Their height, including
base and capital, is 75 feet, and their diameter at the base 7
feet. They are of the Corinthian order, and above them rises
an elaborately moulded entablature, 14 feet in height. The
most striking feature of these buildings is the colossal size of
the stones used in their construction.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable public buildings, whether in the
mother city, or in the provinces, were the Basilicas, or halls of
justice, used also as commercial exchanges. These were generally
oblong, covered halls, divided into three or five aisles by
rows of columns. At one end was a semi-circular recess, the
floor of which was raised considerably above the level of the
rest of the floor, and here the presiding magistrate had his seat.</p>

<p>Although the Romans were not particularly interested in dramatic
representations, they were passionately fond of shows
and games of all kinds. Hence they built many theatres and
amphitheatres in all their cities and large towns. The most
stupendous fabric of the kind that was ever erected was the
Flavian amphitheater or Colosseum, whose ruins attest its
pristine magnificence.</p>

<p>“Arches on arches, as if it were that Rome, collecting the
chief trophies of her line, would build up all the triumphs in one
dome.” It was oblong, 620 feet in length, and 513 feet wide. It
was favorably situated between the Esquiline and the Cœlian
hills, and admirably planned for the convenience of the vast
audiences, estimated at from 50,000 to 80,000. Recent excavations
have revealed the communications that existed between
the arena and the dens, where the wild animals, slaves, and
prisoners were confined. The external façade is composed of
four stories, separated by entablatures that run completely
round the building, without a break. The three lower stories
consist of a series of semi-circular arched openings, eighty in
number, separated by piers with attached columns in front of
them, the Doric order being used in the lowest story, the
Ionic in the second, and the Corinthian in the third.</p>

<p>From these meager facts the reader must imagine the magnificence
and grandeur of the Colosseum, or seek for fuller
information in works of ancient art. Nothing can give us a
more impressive idea of the grandeur and lavish display of
Imperial Rome, than the remains of the huge Thermæ or bathing
establishments. These belong mostly to the Christian era.</p>

<p>Agrippa built the first, A. D. 10, and thence to 324 A. D., no
less than twelve of these vast establishments were erected by
different emperors, including Constantine, and bequeathed to
the people. The baths of Caracalla and Diocletian are the only
ones that remain in any state of preservation, and were probably
the finest and most extensive of them all.</p>

<p>There is one ancient building in Rome more impressive than
any other—not only because of its better state of preservation,
but because of the dignity with which it was designed, the perfection
of execution, and the effectiveness of the mode in which
the interior is lighted—the Pantheon. It is the finest example
of a domed hall that is left. It has the circular form with a
diameter of 145 feet, and a height to the top of the dome of 147
feet. The magnificent dome is enriched with boldly recessed
panels, and these covered with bronze ornaments.</p>

<p>The domestic architecture of the Romans at an early day was
rich, but few traces of it remain. The buildings were of two
kinds; the <i>insula</i>, or block of buildings, containing a number
of buildings, and the <i>domus</i>, or detached mansion.</p>

<p>Their buildings, in the first centuries rude, came, in time, to
have a very decided architectural character. We gather from
them that daring, energy, readiness, structural skill, and a not
too fastidious taste were characteristics of Roman architects and
their works.</p>

<h3>BYZANTINE ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>Constantine the Great, who had encouraged the erection of
houses of Christian worship in Rome and other parts of Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
exerted a marked influence on architecture when he removed
the seat of empire from Rome to Byzantium, and called the new
capital Constantinople. He rebuilt the city that was almost in
ruins, though not deserted. The people were largely of the
Greek race, and had Greek ideas of architecture. Hence a new
development of the church building differing somewhat from
the style of the basilicas soon showed itself.</p>

<p>In Byzantium buildings of most original design sprang up,
founded, it is true, on Roman originals, but by no means exact
copies of them. The most difficult problems of construction,
particularly of roofs, were successfully met and solved.</p>

<p>What course the art ran during the two centuries between
the refounding of Byzantium and the building of Santa Sophia,
we can only infer from its outcome. But it is certain that to attain
the power of designing and erecting so great a work as
Santa Sophia, the architects of Constantinople must have greatly
modified and improved the Roman practice of building vaults
and domes.</p>

<p>The first church dedicated to Santa Sophia by Constantine
was burnt early in the reign of Justinian; and, in rebuilding it,
his architects succeeded in erecting one of the most famous
buildings in the world, and one which is the typical and central
embodiment of a distinct and strongly marked, well-defined
style. Its distinctive feature is the adoption of the dome in preference
to the vault, or timber roof, as the covering of the walls.
In this grand edifice, one vast flattish dome dominates the central
space. This dome is circular in form and the space over
which it is placed is square, the sides of which are occupied by
four massive semi-circular arches of 100 feet span each, springing
from four vast piers, one at each corner. The triangular
spaces in the corners of the square, so enclosed, and the circle
or ring resting on it, become portions of the dome, each just
sufficient to fit on one corner of the square, and the four uniting
at their upper margin, to form a ring. From this ring springs
the main dome that rises to a height of 46 feet, and is 107 feet
in clear diameter. Externally this church is less interesting,
but its interior is of surpassing beauty, and is thus eloquently
described by Gilbert Scott: “Simple as is the primary ideal,
the actual effect is one of great intricacy, and of continuous
gradation of parts from the small arcades up to the stupendous
dome which hangs with little apparent support, like a vast bubble,
over the centre; or, as Procopius, who witnessed its erection,
said, ‘as if suspended by a chain from heaven.’” The type
of church of which this magnificent cathedral was the great example,
has continued in eastern Christendom to the present day
with but little variation. Between Rome and Constantinople,
well situated for receiving influences from both those cities, was
Ravenna,—and there a series of buildings, all more or less Byzantine,
was erected. The most interesting of these is the
church of San Vitale. It recalls Santa Sophia, and its structure,
sculpture, carving and mosaic decorations are equally characteristic
and hardly less famous.</p>

<p>We need only mention one other magnificent specimen of
this style of architecture, more within the reach of ordinary
travelers, and consequently better known. It can be studied
easily by means of almost numberless photographic representations—St.
Marks, at Venice. It was built between the years 977
and 1071, it is said, according to a design obtained from Constantinople.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>This term is used to indicate a style of architecture founded
on Roman art, which prevailed in Western Europe before the
rise of that known as Gothic.</p>

<p>Under this general name, if applied broadly, many closely
allied local varieties, as for example, the Lombard, Rhenish,
Saxon, and Norman, can be conveniently included. After the
removal of the Roman capital to Byzantium, and the incursion
of the Northern tribes, the spectacle of Europe was melancholy
in the extreme.</p>

<p>Nothing but the church retained any semblance of organized
existence; and when, at length, order began to be restored from
a chaos of universal ruin, and churches began to be built in
Western Europe, the people looked to Rome as their ecclesiastic
center.</p>

<p>Where the Romish church had influence, the architecture had
the Roman type; and, where the Eastern church prevailed, it
adhered closely to the Byzantium models. This style, with
local varieties, still obtains in most parts of Europe, and, to some
extent, in American church building. An architect of genius
and taste may successfully combine different orders; but most
who attempt it fail. To succeed well, a good degree of originality
is needed.</p>

<p>Who, that reads poetry at all, has not read and admired “Snow-Bound?”
“That exquisite poem has no prototype in English literature
unless Burns’ ‘Cotter’s Saturday Night’ be one, and it will be long, I
fear, before it will have a companion piece. Out of materials of the
slightest order, really common-place, Mr. Whittier had made a poem
that will live, and can no more be rivaled by any winter poetry that may
be written hereafter, than ‘Thanatopsis’ can be rivaled as a meditation
on the universality of death. The characters of this little idyl are carefully
drawn.… Everything is naturally introduced, and the reflections,
which are manly and pathetic, are among the finest that Mr. Whittier has
ever written. ‘Snow-Bound’ at once authenticated itself as an idyl of
New England life and manners.”—(Abridged) <i>R. H. Stoddard.</i></p>

<p>As in the case of Hood, the fun in Holmes is always jostling the
pathos. After some comic picture or grotesque phrase or quick thrust,
the reader comes suddenly upon a stanza of perfect beauty of form with
the gentlest touch of natural feeling. To illustrate this, it may be pardonable
to quote even from so well known a poem as “The Last Leaf:”</p>

eternally new to the new generations, because they are founded in nature,

<h3 id="LOWELL">JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is not necessary to say that Lowell is the first poet of the time, or of
the country, although it would be possible to maintain that proposition
with strong reasons; but it will be conceded, we think, by most who
have the capacity of appreciating poetic genius, that in some of his
strains he reaches a note as lofty and clear and pure as any this generation
has produced, and has written what will have long life in the
world, and be hoarded by the wise as treasures of thought and expression.—<i>Boston
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>The wisdom and wit and insight and imagination of the book are as
delightful as they are surprising. The most cynical critic will not
despair of American literature, if American authors are to write such
books.—<i>G. W. Curtis.</i></p>

<p>The moving power of Mr. Lowell’s poetry, which we take to be its
delicate apprehension of the spiritual essence in common things, is, in
some of his poems, embodied in the fine organization of a purely poetic
diction; in others, in the strong, broad language of popular feeling and
humor; and we enjoy each the more for the presence of the other.—<i>The
Spectator</i> (London).</p>

<p>The world is impatient of distinction; it chafes against it,
rails at it, insults it, hates it; it ends by receiving its influence,
and by undergoing its law. This quality at last inexorably corrects
the world’s blunders, and fixes the world’s ideals. It procures
that the popular poet shall not finally pass for a Pindar,
nor the popular historian for a Tacitus, nor the popular preacher
for a Bossuet.—<i>Matthew Arnold.</i></p>

<p>“Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth, in
order, a declaration” of such things as pertain to our national
history, even as they testify to us who were contemporary with
the events narrated, it seems good for me also to write, not
because what may be here recorded will be new to the readers,
but rather to call to remembrance things that were known, but
are partially forgotten; and possibly to put them in such form
that the tenure by which they are held may hereafter be more
secure.</p>

<p>If greatly interested in the annals of other nations, whether
ancient or modern, and ready to gather instruction alike from
their excellencies and defects, their failures and successes, the
American citizen should certainly find special interest in the
history of his own country. Whatever else fails to interest
him, a freeman, worthy of his heritage, will carefully study the
elements of strength or weakness, security or danger of our institutions.
Knowing, as he must, that the events that pass in
succession before him are not causeless, or without meaning, he
both inquires for their source, and hears their prophecy of the
future. When others see but happenings and accidents, the

<div class="verse">“There’s a Divinity that shapes our ends,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Rough-hew them as we will.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>American, or United States history is luminous from its earliest
dawn. Unlike other histories in the prescribed course, as
the Greek and Roman, reaching back to such remote antiquity
as to become quite lost in the shadowy past, ours has
none of that “mythological period;” no age in which nymphs
and dryads, fauns and satyrs, gods and demi-gods are introduced
as actors. The annals of the earliest American civilization
record not legends and fables, but facts, things of actual
occurrence and thoroughly attested by those who knew well
whereof they affirmed. Those introduced as sages and heroes,
challenging our admiration for the wisdom of their counsels
and valor of their deeds were not myths, of whose very existence
there is doubt. Great men, indeed, they were, and worthy
of all the honors received; yet, but men, and subject to the
limitations and liabilities of our common manhood.</p>

<p>We do not deify those to whom we are most indebted, or surround
honored names with the flowers of rhetoric. The praise
that is merited is bestowed as it is due to the truth.</p>

<p>The pioneers in the settlement of the continent, by laying
the foundations of our free institutions, and starting their communities
toward the advanced civilization now enjoyed, conferred
on us lasting obligations; but in regard to many of them
“they builded better than they knew.” Often they were rude,
narrow, superstitious and mistaken, though earnest, manly and
sincere; their best eulogy is to tell the story as it was.</p>

<p>The sources of reliable information on which we may draw
are so abundant there can be no want of material. The only
embarrassment is from the riches in possession. To make the
most judicious selection for a succinct yet coherent, suggestive
narration is a task of no ordinary difficulty. The country itself
first demands some notice, before we speak of its inhabitants
and their institutions. The domain of the great American
Union is now nearly four times as large as at the close of the
Revolutionary war. The thirty-nine sovereign states, District
of Columbia, and eight large organized territories occupy an
area of 3,280,572 square miles, with a reserve of 600,000 square
miles of unoccupied or sparsely inhabited territory, from which
we know not how many states may be made after the population
has been sufficiently increased.</p>

<p>The commonwealth, not including Alaska, is bounded north
by the British possessions in America, from which it is partly
separated by the great northern lakes, Superior, Huron, St.
Clair, Erie and Ontario, with the St. Clair, Niagara and St.
Lawrence rivers; east by New Brunswick, the Atlantic Ocean,
and the Gulf of Mexico; south by the Gulf of Mexico and the
Mexican border; west by the Pacific Ocean. The greatest
length, from the Atlantic to the Pacific is 2600 miles; the
greatest breadth, from Maine to Florida, 1600 miles. The
frontier line toward British America measures 3,303 miles, and
the coast line 12,909 miles. With such possessions, stretching
across the continent from ocean to ocean, and over 25° in latitude,
having exhaustless resources, a climate sufficiently varied,
a free government, and just laws, we may well say the future
of the nation is full of promise.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE ABORIGINES.</h3>

<p>But little account can or need be given of the savage tribes
inhabiting the continent when it first became known to the
civilized world.</p>

<p>Men multiplied on the earth and spread themselves widely
over its habitable portions for ages, during which, in their dispersion,
little was known by the clans of each other, or of the
world beyond their local habitations. The few imperfect records
made were not lasting, and the generations following often
lost all knowledge of their own origin.</p>

<p>In most European countries the once uncultured savage
tribes either improving, through their own exertions, escaped
by degrees from the effete barbarisms of their ancestors, or when
overcome by foes of superior intelligence, they profited by their
subjugation, and, accepting the better civilization of their conquerors,
became important factors in the provincial governments
that were established. These carried with them a little
legendary knowledge. The earliest historians, as Herodotus
and others, recorded many of their legends that were mere
fancies—unauthentic fabrications relating to their pre-historic
days.</p>

<p>We have no such mythical elements in American history,
particularly in the history of the United States. The first inhabitants
(wild men of the forest) were possibly as rude and
superstitious as any in the Orient. But the North American
Indians of our region were never, unless in a few exceptional
cases, made integral parts of the new communities established
in the country. When friendly relations were sought they
made treaties, retiring from the grounds they sold; and, when
subject to hostile attack, they fell or fled before the invaders.
Without letters or art, the rude monuments they left had little
significance. Their few oral traditions did not descend to them
from days very remote, and their origin is wrapped in mystery.
From what branch of the human family their ancestors came,
or by what route they reached the continent, is not known.</p>

<p>If all the tribes had a common origin in this country it evidently
must have been very remote, as they were found widely
different in language and other tribal peculiarities. Some resemblance
may be traced, but only by long separation and
different modes of life could members of the same family become
so dissimilar.</p>

<p>The number of Indians previous to the settlement of the
country by European colonists can only be estimated. It was
great, and they spread over most parts of the continent. That
it was overestimated is probable. Not much given to planting
or building, but living principally by the chase, and on what
the earth produced without tillage, they were more or less nomadic
in their habits, and the bounds of their habitation not
well defined. Yet, as tribes, they appropriated lands, and
counted at least the number of their warriors who could go
out to battle.</p>

<p>The great nations—the Esquimaux, Algonquins, Iroquois,
Mobillians and Dacotas seem to have been confederacies, each
made up of several tribes, usually acting together in war; but,
in peace, content to occupy their own hunting grounds. But a
small number of all the Indians now on the continent are
within the bounds of the United States, and the number is
growing less. That the wild men of the forest vanish before
the advancing hosts of civilization is doubtless true. The whole
number at present in all the states and territories, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Alaska, probably does not exceed 200,000, much the larger
number being women and children; a pitiable remnant of the
one hundred and fifty-two tribes of warlike men, whose braves
were a terror to their foes. The Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws,
Chickisaws, now in the Indian Territory, with the remnants of
tribes that remain on small reservations in the states, in all
about 50,000, are in a more hopeful condition. They have already
a good degree of civilization, and many of them cordially
accept the teachings and institutions of Christianity.
They have their homes, schools, ministers and churches. They
practice the industries of civilized life, and in their moral and
religious habits are scarcely inferior to their white neighbors.
These may in time take their places as states in the Union, or
personally become citizens of other states, as they elect. If
they do not, extinction seems to be inevitable. They may receive,
as they should, kind and liberal treatment. But to remain
very long wards of the government, retaining a distinct
nationality in the midst of powerful and rapidly increasing
communities, from whom they are separated by no sufficient
natural boundaries, is simply impossible. The only hope for
them is in citizenship, collectively or personally obtained.</p>

<p>The physical character of the country will be best understood
when spoken of in connection with the political divisions.
It presents as much variety as any other great section of the
globe. There is both beauty and grandeur. The intelligent
beholder from other shores is impressed with the vastness of
what he sees. There are great prairies, plains and forests—with
trees the largest in the world; great lakes, rivers and cataracts;
magnificent mountain ranges, abounding in scenery as
grand as the eye need look upon. It was just the place in
which to found a great empire, and build institutions to last for
ages.</p>

<h3>THE PERIOD OF DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p>The last half century has thrown much light on the question
of discovery; and evidence is conclusive that it dates at least
six hundred years before the first European settlement at
Jamestown, Va., in May, 1607. In 1001 Lief Erickson, an
Icelandic captain, with a small company of daring Norsemen,
sailed from Greenland, reached Labrador, and, in the spirit of
adventure, coasted as far south as Massachusetts, where they
remained a year. Thorwald, a brother of the last named hero,
made a voyage a year later to Maine and Massachusetts, where
he died. In 1005 and 1007 there came larger crews from the
same region, and made more extended explorations, but apparently
with no well defined object in view. Those Norsemen,
from the extreme northwestern part of Europe, were a rough
race of dangerous pirates—bold, hardy, but ignorant navigators,
known and dreaded by the countries they visited as the
terrible “sea kings” of that age. Rovers over all seas to
which they found access, they explored unknown lands for
plunder, not for settlement. Nothing valuable resulted from
their discoveries. For centuries all knowledge gained by them
was lost, and nothing was known in Europe of their voyages.
The very name, Vinland, given to the country in Iceland, was
for ages lost. And the more intelligent efforts, afterward made,
were in no way suggested, so far as we know, by even vague
rumors of what these sea robbers found. The continent discovered
by accident, was, through ignorance, never made
known to the civilized world; and so, for centuries, remained
the <i>terra incognita</i>; and the real discovery of such untold
value to the race was reserved for those of more intelligence,
who purposely, at great sacrifice, and guided by scientific
principles, sought the western hemisphere, of whose existence
they were confident.</p>

<p>Christopher Columbus, born at Genoa, Italy, in 1435, was
carefully educated, and interested in maritime matters from
his youth. Mandeville, the traveler, had proclaimed the earth
a sphere, or round, and had given his reasons. Columbus not
only had faith in the astronomical discovery, but sought to turn
his knowledge to some practical account. He argued, conclusively,
that the world being round, if there were no intervening
lands to hinder sailing westward over the open seas, he would
much easier than by the known route, reach the spice lands of
the East Indias. That was the object of his search, and when,
after seventy-one days sailing, land was sighted, the anxious
voyagers supposed their end was gained. He first stepped
ashore, unfurled their flag, and finding the place an island,
named it San Salvador. Three or four other islands of the
group were added to his discoveries during the voyage; but the
main land was not visited, and from a misconception as to the
size of the earth, supposing it to be only 12,000 or 14,000 miles
in circumference, they supposed the fertile, salubrious isles
then discovered were near the coast of India, and so named
them the West Indias.</p>

<p>Columbus made a second voyage, discovered several more
islands, and established a colony at Hayti, his brother being
governor. After an absence of three years he returned to
Spain, to find himself suspected, accused, and the victim of a
relentless persecution. His enemies not only stripped him of
his merited honors as a discoverer, but to further compass his
disgrace, sent him from his colony he had revisited a prisoner
in chains. Though soon released and fully vindicated, the
balance of his days were clouded. It remained for posterity
to rescue his name from oblivion. Though the less deserving
Florentine, Amerigo Vespucci, by his craft and the dullness of
the times, succeeded in attaching his name to the continent,
we still heartily sing “Hail Columbia,” in memory of the real
discoverer, while many towns, counties and cities perpetuate
the honored name.</p>

<p>Within ten years after the death of Columbus the principal
islands of the West Indias were explored, and settlements were
commenced. The excitement becoming intense not only in
Spain, but in the western states of Europe, adventurers increased.
In 1512 a Spaniard, rich and well advanced in years,
left Porto Rico, touched at San Salvador, and in due time came
in sight of an unknown land that seemed, as they entered it, a
place of beauty; he named it Florida, or land of flowers.
This, too, was supposed another island, more beautiful than
any before discovered. A landing was effected, and the country
claimed for the King of Spain. The coast was explored for
many leagues, some valuable information gained, and the adventurers
sailed back to Porto Rico. Afterward Ponce, the
aged explorer, was sent to found a colony, and be its governor.
In 1521 he again landed, but his right to rule was contested by
the Indians, who were found in a state of bitter hostility. They
at once made a furious attack. Many of the Spaniards were
killed, and Ponce De Leon, wounded by an arrow, was carried
back to Cuba to die.</p>

<p>In 1519 Fernando Cortes landed at Tabasco, and began the
conquest of Mexico. As that section of the continent is without
the limits of the United States, we avoid a detailed statement
of his progress, marked by the unexampled rapacity and cruelty
of the invaders. Tens of thousands of the unoffending—many
of them unarmed—inhabitants were not slain in battle,
but massacred in their streets and homes.</p>

<p>The lust of gold, rather than ambition, was the ruling passion,
and the treasures of the Montezumas failed to satisfy it.
Drenched in the blood of her citizens, Mexico became a Spanish
province. The Spaniards bore the christian name, and
sadly disgraced it. The appalling scenes of treachery, cruelty
and bloodshed they enacted are scarcely equaled in the annals
of savage warfare. To turn from them is a relief.</p>

seems to me always, in these moments of calm, that I should
have been the happiest man in the world with an income of
twenty-five hundred dollars a year, living as the father of a
family with my wife and son, in our old home at Ajaccio.…
I still remember with emotion the minute details of a journey
in which I accompanied Paoli. More than five hundred of us,
young persons of the first families in the island, formed his
body-guard. I felt proud of walking by his side, and he
appeared to take pleasure in pointing out to me the passes of
our mountains which had been witnesses of the heroic struggle
of our countrymen for independence. The impressions made
upon me still vibrate in my heart.… Religion is the dominion
of the soul. It is the hope of life, the anchor of safety, the
deliverance from evil. What a service has Christianity rendered
to humanity! What a power would it still have did its
ministers comprehend their mission!”</p>

<p>Napoleon’s hand-writing was of a most unintelligible character.
“Do you write orthographically?” he asked his amanuensis
one day at St. Helena. “A man occupied with public
business can not attend to orthography. His ideas must flow
faster than his hand can trace. He has only time to place his
points. He must compress words into letters, and phrases into
words, and let the scribes make it out afterward.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The rapid succession of your victories,” said Las Cases to
Napoleon, “must have been a source of great delight to you.”
“By no means,” Napoleon replied; “those who think so know
nothing of the peril of our situation. The victory of to-day was
instantly forgotten in preparation for the battle which was to
be fought on the morrow. The aspect of danger was continually
before me. I enjoyed not one moment of repose.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Tents,” said Napoleon, “are unhealthy; it is much better
for the soldier to bivouac in the open air, for then he can build
a fire and sleep with warm feet. Tents are necessary only for
the general officers, who are obliged to read and consult their
maps.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“My extreme youth when I took command of the army of
Italy,” Napoleon remarked, “made it necessary for me to
evince great reserve of manner, and the utmost severity of
morals. This was indispensable to enable me to sustain authority
over men so greatly superior in age and experience. I pursued
a line of conduct in the highest degree irreproachable and
exemplary. In spotless morality I was a Cato, and must have
appeared such to all. I was a philosopher and a sage. My
supremacy could be retained only by proving myself a better
man than any other in the army. Had I yielded to human
weaknesses I should have lost my power.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Napoleon sent the celebrated picture of St. Jerome from the
Duke of Parma’s gallery to the Museum at Paris. The duke, to
save his work of art, offered Napoleon two hundred thousand
dollars, which the conqueror refused to take, saying: “The
sum which he offers will be soon spent; but the possession of
such a masterpiece at Paris will adorn that capital for ages, and
give birth to similar exertions of genius.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Different matters are arranged in my head,” said Napoleon,
“as in drawers. I open one drawer and close another as I wish.
I have never been kept awake by an involuntary pre-occupation
of the mind. If I desire repose I shut up all the drawers,
and sleep. I have always slept when I wanted rest, and almost
always at will.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While at Milan, Napoleon had just mounted his horse one
morning, when a dragoon, bearing important dispatches, presented
himself before him. Napoleon gave a verbal answer and
ordered the courier to take it back with all speed.</p>

<p>“I have no horse,” the man answered. “I rode mine so hard
that it fell dead at your palace gates.”</p>

<p>Napoleon alighted. “Take mine,” he said.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>“You think him too magnificently caparisoned and too fine
an animal,” said Napoleon. “Nothing is too good for a French
soldier.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Pavia,” said Napoleon, “is the only place I ever gave up to
pillage. I promised that the soldiers should have it at their
mercy for twenty-four hours; but after three hours I could bear
such scenes of outrage no longer, and put an end to them.
Policy and morality are equally opposed to the system. Nothing
is so certain to disorganize and completely ruin an army.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I have,” said Napoleon, “a taste for founding, not for possessing.
My riches consist in glory and celebrity. The Simplon
and the Louvre were, in the eyes of the people and of foreigners,
more my property than any private domains could possibly
have been.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To General Clark, on the death of his nephew, at Arcola,
Napoleon wrote: “Your nephew, Elliott, has been slain upon
the battlefield. That young man has several times marched at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the head of our columns. He has died gloriously, and in the
face of the enemy. He did not have a moment’s suffering.
Where is the <i>reasonable man</i> who would not envy such a death?
Where is he who, in the vicissitudes of life would not give himself
up to leave in this manner a world so often ungrateful?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Napoleon had no tendencies to gallantry. Madame de Stäel
once said to him: “It is reported that you are not very partial
to the ladies.” “I am very fond of my wife, Madame,” was the
laconic reply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The English,” said Napoleon, “appear to prefer the bottle
to the society of their ladies; as is exemplified by dismissing
the ladies from the table and remaining for hours to drink and
intoxicate themselves. If I were in England I should decidedly
leave the table with the ladies. If the object is to talk instead
of to drink, why banish them. Surely conversation is never so
lively nor so witty as when ladies take a part in it. Were I an
Englishwoman I should feel very discontented at being turned
out by the men to wait for two or three hours while they were
drinking. In France, society is nothing unless ladies are present.
They are the life of conversation.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A lady of rank once said to him, “What is life worth if one
cannot be General Bonaparte?” Napoleon answered her wisely:
“Madame! one may be a dutiful wife and the good mother of a
family.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Traveling through Switzerland, Napoleon was greeted with
such enthusiasm that Bourrienne said to him, “It must be delightful
to be greeted with such demonstrations of enthusiastic
admiration.” “Bah,” replied Napoleon; “this same unthinking
crowd under a slight change of circumstances would follow me
just as eagerly to the scaffold.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Speaking of the Theophilanthropists, Napoleon said, “They
can accomplish nothing; they are merely actors.” “What!”
was the reply; “do you thus stigmatize those whose tenets inculcate
universal benevolence and the moral virtues?” “All
moral systems are fine,” rejoined Napoleon. “The Gospel
alone has shown a full and complete assemblage of the principles
of morality, stripped of all absurdity. It is not made up,
like your creed, of a few commonplace sentences put into bad
verse. Do you wish to find out the really sublime? Repeat
the Lord’s Prayer. Such enthusiasts are only to be met with the
weapons of ridicule; all their efforts will prove ineffectual.”</p>

<h2 id="MATTHEW_ARNOLD">MATTHEW ARNOLD.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Prof. A. B. HYDE, D.D.</span></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>A man of letters, eminent in England, deserves, on visiting these
shores, our brotherly attention. Nothing so holds us in fellowship
with the people of “the little mother-land” as our reading
their literature, and their reading ours, without translation.
Their writers and speakers are thus our true kinsfolk, nearer to
us than French or German can be. Mr. Arnold, known well
rather than widely, has position among English thinkers of our
day, such as demands for the readers of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
a reasonable understanding of him and his work. His essays
and addresses are published in seven volumes by MacMillan
&amp; Co. His poems, in two or three volumes, are had from the
same house. He came to this country partly to visit and partly
to deliver a few lectures. Mr. Arnold was born at Christmas
of 1822, in Laleham, where his father was privately fitting students
for the universities. His father, Thomas Arnold, eminent
as clergyman and historian, is still more famed as teacher. At
Rugby school his pupils loved and honored him. He understood
the good and evil of English boys, and with wonderful
skill he trained them in sound learning, and moulded them to
pure and generous character. Gaining from him the tone of
manly sentiment, many of his “Tom Browns” have been blessings
to their generation.</p>

<p>Matthew was his eldest son. Another, Delafield Arnold,
early worn out in the educational work of India, was buried on
his homeward voyage, at Gibraltar, while his devoted wife went
to a grave under the solemn shadow of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>In Matthew’s boyhood the family home was fixed at Fox How,
near the abode of the poet Wordsworth. Here in his vacations
the father studied, and Matthew could see Coleridge,
Southey, and Wordsworth, the “Lake Poets.” To Fox How,
haunt of the muses, a crowd of distinguished visitors made
streaming pilgrimage, and here the lad who early “seemed no
vulgar boy,” could absorb the deep things of reason and the
sweet things of song. He deeply revered these men under
whose shadow he sat as a boyish listener. Of his father he
says: “We rested till then in thy shade, as under the boughs
of an oak. Toil and dejection have tried thy spirit, of that we
say nothing. To us thou wast still cheerful and helpful and
firm.”</p>

<p>After Wordsworth’s death he says of the dear and venerable
man to whom his eyes in young weariness had often turned for
refreshment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He spake and loosed our heart in tears,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Our youth returned, for there was shed</div>
<div class="verse i1">On spirits that had long been dead,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The freshness of the early world.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1840, having prepared under his father, he was elected a
scholar at Baliol College, Oxford, and four years later he gained
a prize for an English poem. The next year he was made a
Fellow of Oriel College. In 1846 he became private secretary
of Lord Lansdowne, and so remained for several years. He
also—after his marriage, in 1851, with Frances Wightman,
daughter of an eminent jurist—served as Her Majesty’s Inspector
of British schools. In 1857 he was with sharp competition
chosen Professor of Poetry at Oxford. The term of office is
ten years. Finding himself in later years growing alien from
poetic composition (“these lips but rarely frame them now”),
he allowed the place to pass to Principal Shairp, a man more
distinguished as a critic than a producer of poetry. Mr. Arnold
still gives an occasional poem, oftenest on simple themes, as
the death of his terrier, “Geist,” or his canary, “Matthias.”
His “Westminster Abbey,” on the death of Dean Stanley, is
grand as an anthem. He is now heard chiefly in essays, critical
and æsthetic, and educational or other addresses. He is of
noble presence and kindly, earnest face, over which his rich,
full hair, now sable-silvered, parts and clusters. He is no orator,
speaking low and slowly, but the charm of his personal
appearance, the beauty of his thought, the clear incisive force
of his silvery rhetoric make him to cultivated audiences ever welcome.
Take him for all in all, he is so felt to-day and sure to
be so read and felt hereafter, that some study of him as thinker
and poet may be both instructive and entertaining.</p>

<p>Of his lectures in this country the best was on Emerson, whom
he prized as “the friend and aid of those who wished to live in
the spirit.”</p>

<p>His first stir of thought was from Wordsworth, not young
Wordsworth, the flush “high-priest of man and nature and of
human life,” but from the venerable laureate, when his utterances
began to have “the sweetness, the gravity, the beauty,
the languor of death.” The lofty energy which Arnold inherited
from his father was seriously impaired by the contemplative
egotism of his father’s friend. At the time when impressions
deep and lasting were easily made on his young mind, Goethe,
critic and artist of many generations, went to his grave.
“Knowest thou,” says Carlyle, “no prophet even in the vesture,
environment and dialect of this age? I know him and
name him Goethe. In him man’s life begins again to be divine.”
Goethe had at first held the principles of Rousseau. Later he
announced with the serenity of a Brahmin and the authority of a
Delphic oracle, that the chief end of man is “to cultivate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
own spirit.” This utterance fell like a gospel on Arnold’s ear.
He began to expound and enforce it, striving to engraft it on
literary society and to embody it in the English national life.
To him we owe that sense of the word “culture” which is so
hard to state, and other terms and phrases, as “perfection,
sweetness and light,” “harmonious development,” and the like.
A better English pleader for the new “development” could
hardly have been found. Clear and graceful in statement,
gentle under criticism, patient under reproof and witty in reply,
his one defect is in not doing what both the sacred and the
profane oracles enjoin as the first thing in culture—to understand
himself. Let us trace his ideas and doctrines in politics,
in education, in religion, and in poetry.</p>

<p>His view of the human race is that we are utterly separate,
“enisled,” each forever by himself as in “the unplumbed, salt,
estranging sea.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yes, in the sea of life enisled,</div>
<div class="verse i3">With echoing straits between us thrown,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Dotting the shoreless, watery wild,</div>
<div class="verse i3">We mortal millions live <i>alone</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It follows from this isolation (which is in one sense true) that
no man can be his brother’s keeper. A strong-lunged islander
can <i>call</i> to his fellow, but nothing more. With this view of the
“environment” the first duty ever to be taught and ever
rehearsed is <i>endurance</i>. Patience under an order of things that
“man did not make and can not mar,” is a teaching traceable
through all his poetry and prose. Then comes in many a
pleasing form the lesson of “self-centering.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“With joy the stars perform their shining,</div>
<div class="verse i3">And the sea its long, moon-silvered roll;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Why? self-poised they live, nor pine with noting</div>
<div class="verse i3">All the fever of some differing soul.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Bounded by themselves and unregarding</div>
<div class="verse i3">In what state God’s other works may be</div>
<div class="verse i1">In their own tasks all their powers pouring,</div>
<div class="verse i3">These attain the mighty life you see.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the “hopeless tangle of our age,” to which he is keenly
alive, and to explore which is a task of misery and distress,
“alone, self-poised, henceforward man must labor.” “No man
can save his brother’s soul, nor pay his brother’s debt.” As
man is thus set apart from his fellow, “self-culture,” “self-perfecting”
are his duty and his chief concern. By culture Mr.
Arnold means the development of every capacity and power
enfolded within us, and the adapting of ourselves perfectly to
the island, larger or smaller, of our Crusoe life. This culture
is gained not by unions, coöperations, or harangues “with tremendous
cheers.” It is of one’s self and for one’s self, save
as the wind may waft the odors of one “islet” to another.
Culture must come by patient personal effort. Here Mr. Arnold
looks back longingly to feudal times, and even beyond. The
evil communications of the present corrupt good manners. He
seems to say “<i>any</i> former times are better than these,” and to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Pine for force</div>
<div class="verse i3">A ghost of time to raise,</div>
<div class="verse i1">As if he thus might stop the course</div>
<div class="verse i3">Of these appointed nays.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such a doctrine can never come well into politics. It is too
remote—unsystematic, not to say fastidious. Pure as Arnold’s
motives are known to be, he is too dainty to serve in a party,
even that of Mr. Gladstone. He scouts “equality,” and prefers
benevolence to democracy. As a result, the “sweetness
and light” shed from his “islet” is little regarded by the
masses, being about as effective as an aurora borealis.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> sums up Arnold’s discourses to the laboring classes—and
all other classes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To Matthew Arnold hark</div>
<div class="verse">With both ears all avidity!</div>
<div class="verse">That Matthew—a man of mark—</div>
<div class="verse">Says “Cultivate Lucidity!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In education Mr. Arnold’s efforts have been steady and sincere.
To him, among others, is due the successful entrance of
young women in England upon higher study, so that Cambridge
and Oxford are now beset by troops of young ladies who
must some day effect entrance. He inherits from his father an
educational zeal. His pleadings for literature in courses of
study as against the exclusive pursuit of physical science and
the “practical” branches, has been earnest and eloquent. He
holds that, to know ourselves and the world, we must know the
best that has been thought and said in the world. The study
of belles-letters may be so conducted as to yield only a smattering
of benefit, but it may be made a very serious and critical
search after truth. What has been done by civilized nations,
and what manner of people they were, is as well worth knowing
as chemistry or geology.</p>

<p>Examining a young man on the meaning of “Canst thou
not minister to a mind diseased?” he received as explanation,
“Can you not wait upon the lunatic?” He asks whether to
know the products of the combustion of wax is better than to
understand Shakspere? He is sure that man’s need of beauty
in truth, and of acquaintance with the general human mind
demands the study of literature, and that for this study the
best of all is the Greek.</p>

<p>Few will question, most teachers will accept, his educational
doctrines.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold explains that to attain perfect culture, we must
be perfectly religious, and for this, we must properly understand
the Bible. This brings us to look at his darkened side.
He is an <i>evolutionist</i> in religion; that is, he holds that as the
ages roll on, new religions unfold in newness of vigor and
meaning, while the old decay and disappear. He tells us that
to-day poetry is the true religion. In our time “every creed is
shaken, every dogma questioned, every tradition dissolving.”
“The strongest part of our religion to-day is its unconscious
poetry, for poetry attaches its emotion to the <i>idea</i>, and all else
is illusion.” Poetry has the highest truth, and the highest seriousness.</p>

<p>“Be ye perfect,” said the Great Teacher, and this, says Mr.
Arnold, is a harmonious development of all sides of our
humanity; a thing not found in our broken world. Therefore
he calls the orthodox belief a failure; the working classes will
have nothing to say to it. He will fix it for them. He takes
out of it all its facts and leaves only its tone and its ideas—its
poetry. The scheme of Christianity has never been understood
until now a select few have grasped it.</p>

<p>“There is an enduring power, not ourselves, which makes for
righteousness”—that is his cloudy piety. The “method” and
“secret” of Jesus were commendable; the “method” was
repentance, the “secret” was peace; but the Christian religion
rests on the assumption of a Personal Ruler, “this cannot be
verified.” Even the resurrection St. Paul poorly understood.
It is in fact “rising to that harmonious conformity with the
real and the eternal which is life and peace until it becomes
glory.” Even the doctrine of the Trinity Mr. Arnold can
speak of as “a fairy-tale of the three Lord Shaftburys,” a
phrase that Ingersoll might quote. One can see—and it is a
sad sight—how his religious views have been spoiled by a vain
philosophy. How reassuring to know that Mr. Moody, preaching
Jesus and the Resurrection at Oxford, in Arnold’s sight,
found the working classes (and others) glad to hear. Where
he had said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Resolve to be thyself! And know that he</div>
<div class="verse">Who finds himself, loses his misery.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many are learning “Deny thyself” and in finding the Savior,
losing their misery.</p>

<p>This gifted disbeliever has longings that he cannot quite conceal.
He does not believe Jesus divine, yet he seems to yearn
for faith in him, such as his father had, and such as was easy
when</p>

<div class="verse">The Syrian stars look down?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last we seem to find this scholar and poet, Christian born
and Christian bred, sinking into the pantheism of heathenism,
such as our missionaries confront in India.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Of the Being in whom we exist,</div>
<div class="verse">Who alone is all things in one?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Through all Mr. Arnold’s utterances there seems a certain
air of condescension. To the masses, “the un-Hellenic public,”
he seems to look from his own “islet” and say, “Cultivate
your own spirit;” “Cherish light and sweetness,” and to add,
“Look at me and aspire to your own best self.” This looks
like a delicate self-worship, such as was in Goethe, and thither
“self-culture” easily leads.</p>

<p>In Mr. Arnold as poet one finds enough to admire and enjoy.
His first volume of poems was given anonymously to the world in
1849. It made some stir. We thought another of the immortals
was among us, and so it proved. He followed in song
the same who were his masters in culture, striving, “Wordsworth’s
sweet calm, and Goethe’s wide and luminous view to
gain.” He took up poetry seriously, for he thought that “poetry
is the impassioned expression in the countenance of all science,”
“the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge.” To him poetry
is no idle warbling, but an intense criticism of life in which he
works from sense of duty. In all his poems one finds dignity
and grace of spirit, something of Goethe’s spiritual unrest, and
of Wordsworth’s healing balm found in communion with nature.</p>

<p>Thus, after Rustum in desperate fight has unknowingly slain
his son Sohrab, (who has disclosed himself in his last moments)
with how quiet dignity does the Oxus move on, leaving on its
bank Sohrab in his gore, and Rustum in his hot agony and
blinding tears!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the majestic river floated on</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the mist and hum of that low land</div>
<div class="verse">Into the frosted starlight, and there moved</div>
<div class="verse">Rejoicing through the hushed Chorasmian waste</div>
<div class="verse">Under the solitary moon, till at last</div>
<div class="verse">The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide</div>
<div class="verse">His luminous home of waters opens bright</div>
<div class="verse">And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars</div>
<div class="verse">Emerge and shine upon the Aral sea.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He comes to nature, not to bring anything, but to seek rest and
refreshment. Byron pours out upon nature, as in Childe Harold,
the “sparkling gloom” of his own spirit. Coleridge, as in
the Hymn at Chamouni, fills nature with his own lofty rapture.
Arnold’s poems all show how he asks of nature, not pleasure or
exaltation—only relief. By the lake he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Nowhere in all his pictures of nature, given in the most
musical of English and in style flowing, bright and tender, do we
find the deep gladness of Wordsworth, or the organ-toned joy
of Milton. To each, as his heart is, nature gives. Arnold,
sad, unbelieving, self-absorbed, looking at his own shadow,
sees the beautiful and sings it, as he finds it, but, “life is wanting
there.” As our human race appears in his poems, the men of
to-day are of small account. “There has passed away a glory
from the earth.” He has little to say of hope, so much in his
eye is the past better than any possible future. Even his favorite
metres are of Greek pattern. Admitting that the Pagan
world, worn and weary, was revived by Christianity, he thinks
this is in its turn “outworn,” and men are waning now. Therefore
he goes to olden time for heroes, for Prometheus and Pericle,
Tristam and Rustum. His only poem truly dramatic, a
complete work of art, is The Sick King in Bokhara. The elements
of the story bring out his genius, and he puts forth the
best effort of his mind and art. Here are that dignified self-poise,
that unrest akin to remorse that frames so strangely with
the calm of helplessness, that lip-curling criticism and that
transparent simplicity of which we have been speaking. All is
brilliant in setting and rich in color. All his poems we might
read (and we should then all the more watch for new ones) but
in none shall find the whole of Mr. Arnold as we find it in
this.</p>

<p>How beautiful is this from Tristam. It is Iseult after the death
of her husband and rival, living with her children, as in a fading,
misty, moon-lit dream:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Joy hath not found her yet, nor ever will,</div>
<div class="verse">Is it this thought that makes her mien so still?</div>
<div class="verse">Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet</div>
<div class="verse">Her children’s? She moves slow; her voice alone</div>
<div class="verse">Hath yet an infantine and silvery tone,</div>
<div class="verse">But even that comes languidly; in truth,</div>
<div class="verse">She seems one dying in the mask of youth.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Arnold does not attain to the first rank of either men or
poets, but there is a charm about him and his poetry. Too
bad it is that he has not the joy and nerve that come of Christian
faith “which worketh by love.” He would diffuse
sweetness and light indeed. But is his poetry, <i>as poetry</i>, the
worse for his lack of faith? Its plaintive utterance of the sadness
of a soul whose wants are proudly shut from their true satisfaction,
will long be read by those who strive to still the <i>heart</i>
with supplies from the <i>intellect</i> and to make genius serve for
Living Bread. No English poet has made the soul-hunger so
attractive, or given airy negatives in forms and colors so fascinating.</p>

<p>It is often found that those feelings which are best, noblest,
and most self-denying, are exactly those which lead to a disastrous
issue. It is as if, by the command of a higher and wiser
power, man’s fate were intentionally brought into variance with
his inner feelings, in order that the latter might acquire a
higher value, shine with greater purity, and thus become more
precious by the very privations and sufferings to him who
cherishes such feelings. However benevolent may be the intentions
of Providence, they do not always advance the happiness
of the individual. Providence has always higher ends in
view, and works in a preëminent degree on the inner feelings
and disposition.—<i>Humboldt.</i></p>

<h2 id="ESTIVATION_OR_SUMMER_SLEEP">ESTIVATION, OR SUMMER SLEEP.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By the <span class="smcap">Rev. J. G. WOOD, M.A.</span></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>I have already mentioned that the peculiar condition which we
term hibernation is one which can be produced by heat as well
as by cold, and that the bat passes into that state daily throughout
summer. The name, therefore, is not sufficiently definite.
The German naturalists more properly use two distinct terms,
and employ the words “winterschlaf,” <i>i. e.</i>, winter sleep, and
“sommerschlaf,” or summer sleep.</p>

<p>In order to maintain the same construction in the terms, I
will call the summer sleep by the name of Estivation. This
word is scientifically more correct than summer sleep, because,
as I have already mentioned, the condition in question is not
real sleep, but a kind of trance.</p>

<p>As Estivation is produced in consequence of the withdrawal
of food by heat, we must naturally look for it within the tropics.
Many of the lower vertebrates are subjected to Estivation, but, as
far as is known, no mammal estivates. It has been said that the
Taurde, or Madagascar hedgehog, does so, but it is evidently
a mistake. It is really one of the hibernators, like our own
hedgehog; and though it assumes the trance condition in June,
that month is the beginning of winter in Madagascar, and not
in the middle of summer, as in England.</p>

<p>I will only take two examples of true Estivation, one from
Africa and the other from America. The first is the well known
Lepidosiren, or mud-fish, a creature which has long been an
enigma to zoölogists, as no one could say definitely whether it
were a fish or a reptile. Professor Owen, however, states that
the structure of its organs of smell proves that it is a true,
though rather anomalous, fish. It is found in many parts of
Africa, and inhabits the banks of muddy rivers, being plentiful
in the Nile.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the systematic naturalists have changed its name
and called it Protopterus, giving the old and equally appropriate
name of Lepidosiren to an allied species which is found in
the Amazon river and its tributaries. I have, however, retained
the original name, and see no sufficient ground for altering
it.</p>

<p>It is brownish grey in color, and eel-like in shape, but has
four curious rudimentary limbs, apparently useless for locomotion,
though they are seldom without movement. They are, in
fact, soft single rays of the pectoral and ventral fins, which represent
the limbs of beings more highly organized. Each ray
carries a narrow strip of membrane along nearly the whole of
its length.</p>

<p>Along part of the back there is a very soft fin, extending over
the tip of the tail, and returning on the under surface of the
body as far as the base of the hind limbs. The body is always
covered with viscous slime, insoluble in water, and the creature
seems to be able to secrete it as it is wanted.</p>

<p>Essentially predacious, it does not possess rank after rank of
teeth, such as we see in the pike, and the wolf-fish, and the
like, but is endowed with a most remarkable dental apparatus.</p>

<p>Instead of separate teeth, there is in each jaw what may
be called a tooth-ribbon. Suppose that we imagine the dental
matter, instead of being made into separate teeth, to be rolled
out into a continuous ribbon, then “pleated” into folds like
those of a ruff, and so set in the jaws. Then let us imagine
the projecting edge of each tooth-ribbon to be as sharp as that
of a chisel, and we can realize the formidable apparatus with
which the mouth is armed.</p>

<p>These details are here briefly given, because without them the
history of its estivation could not be understood.</p>

<p>That the Lepidosiren was carnivorous had long been known,
but no idea was formed of its voracity until some living specimens
were successfully reared in the Crystal Palace. One of
them was placed in the large water basin which then adorned
the center of the tropical department at the north end of the
Palace, but which may now be seen in the open air between
the Palace and the water tower.</p>

<p>Though confined in a tank, it contrived to escape into the
basin, and straightway began to make havoc among the gold-fish.
It swam gently under them, rose with open jaws, caught
the fish just behind the pectoral fins, bit out a piece, its ribbon-like
teeth cutting through scale, bone, and flesh, as if they had
been shears, and sank out of sight with its prey. It never bit
the same fish twice, and as long as it could find fish, declined
to eat anything else.</p>

<p>As this mode of feeding involved a gold-fish for each mouthful,
Mr. F. W. Wilson, who was then in charge of the Natural
History Department of the Crystal Palace, had the tank emptied,
and fenced off a portion with wire grating, so that the
Lepidosiren could not get at the fish. The creature was then
fed with frogs, which I have seen it eat; and by reason of the
perpetual supply of food, it grew so fast that it attained a length
of thirty inches and weighed six pounds and a quarter, a very
giant of Lepidosirens, which seldom exceed eighteen inches in
length.</p>

<p>It lived for more than three years, and might have grown to
a much larger size, but for the neglect of an attendant who forgot
on one winter night to keep up the fire which warmed the
water, and in consequence this interesting creature was found
dead next morning.</p>

<p>Here then we have a carnivorous being of more than ordinary
voracity, and requiring a constant supply of fish. But,
during the rainless summer, the water is rapidly evaporated
under the sun’s rays, the fish die, and the muddy bed of the
river becomes as dry and nearly as hard as brick. What then
is the Lepidosiren to do?</p>

<p>By Divine Providence, the heat which withdraws its food acts
upon it as cold acts upon hibernating animals in this country.
As soon as the drying-up process has begun, the Lepidosiren
wriggles itself into the mud while it is still soft, and by dint of
turning round and round, makes a sort of chamber, the sides
of which are preserved from collapsing by the slime which it
pours from its body.</p>

<p>It then doubles itself up sideways in a most curious fashion,
wrapping the membranous tail over its head so as to cover it
entirely. The body is not coiled in a circle, as might be imagined,
but the two inner sides (mostly the left) are pressed closely
against each other, so that the animal occupies a wonderfully
small space. The dimensions of the chamber are soon contracted
by the weight of the superincumbent mud, until at last
there is scarcely the eighth of an inch of free space round the
body.</p>

<p>In this curious refuge the Lepidosiren passes into a state of
Estivation. The mud is gradually dried, and then baked under
the fierce rays of a tropical sun. But the Lepidosiren lies
motionless and unconscious until the next rainy season refills
the river, dissolves the hardened mud, and sets the creature
free to resume its predatory life.</p>

<p>Were it not for the Lepidosiren, the inhabitants of these
countries would often be hardly pressed for food. But they
search the dry bed of the river, dig up the buried estivators and
live on them. So here we have Estivation as well as hibernation,
indirectly beneficial to man. I may mention that most of
the Lepidosirens which have been kept alive in this country
were brought while still buried in their mud cells.</p>

<p>There is little difficulty in finding the hidden Lepidosirens, as
the aperture through which they entered the mud seems almost
invariably to remain open, its smooth and slime-polished sides
leaving no doubt as to its identity.</p>

<p>I have possessed for more than four years a large lump of
dry Nile mud, a hole in one of its sides showing that a Lepidosiren
ought to be inside it. This morning I carefully cut it
open, and there found the inhabitant, doubled up, with its tail
over its head just as when it gave itself up to slumber more
than twenty years ago. I expected to have seen a nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
spherical chamber, but found that the cell is cylindrical, and
only just large enough to hold the creature.</p>

<p>The slime with which the cell is lined has been hardened
into a papery consistence, and is, in fact, about as thick as the
paper on which this account is printed. When a piece is torn
off and held in the flame of a spirit lamp, it takes fire and it
gives out a very nauseous odor, like that of a beetle’s wing case
when similarly burned. This thick coating of slime is only to
be found in the cell itself, and surrounding the body of the
animal. I imagine that the Lepidosiren must deposit many
successive coats of slime after it has taken up its position.
These cells are technically named “cocoons.”</p>

<p>As some time elapses between the falling of the rain, when
the creature awakes, and the dissolving of the cocoon, there
must be some peculiar structure of the respiratory organs.
Otherwise, the Lepidosiren, being a fish, and breathing by gills,
must die before it can reënter the water.</p>

<p>This structure is of a most unexpected character. The creature
has rows of gills on either side of its head, and with these
it breathes while it is in the water. The swimming-bladder,
however, is modified so as to act as a substitute for a lung. A
branch of the artery which supplies the gills is diverted to the
swimming-bladder, and as there is a communication between
the interior of the swimming-bladder and the external air, the
creature is able to aerate its blood sufficiently to sustain life
until it can assume its normal fish life.</p>

<p>I may here mention that these African and American Lepidosirens,
together with the Australian Ceratodus are especially
interesting as being one only living survivor of a vast family
which in bygone ages were extremely numerous.</p>

<p>The Ceratodus is a comparatively new discovery, and came
on naturalists by surprise. Until lately the only known examples
of this fish were to be found in the earlier secondary rocks,
and when it was announced that living specimens had been
found, the discovery could hardly be believed. However,
there the Ceratodus is. It looks like a resuscitated fossil, and is
to our known fishes what the tree-fern is to our present vegetation.</p>

<p>There is another interesting point about this object, showing
how Estivation is connected with Scripture.</p>

<p>The mud of which the cocoon is made is the same as that
which the Israelites, while in captivity, were forced to make
into bricks. It is so tenacious, that although merely dried by
the Egyptian sun, it is so hard that I was obliged to employ
mallet, chisel, saw, and butcher’s knife, while making the
necessary sections.</p>

<p>Occasionally the difficulty was increased by vegetable fibers
which had become mixed with it, and which bound it together
just as the cow-hairs bind builder’s plaster when honestly made.
The Egyptians mixed straw with the clay of which their bricks
were made, so as to strengthen it, and in order to secure a supply
of such straw they did not reap their corn near the ground
as we do, but cut off the ears close to the stem, leaving the
stubble to be cut separately. The reader will remember that
one of the grievances of the captives was, that instead of being
supplied with straw, as formerly, they had to cut and fetch the
stubble for themselves, and yet were forced to deliver the same
number of bricks daily.</p>

<p>So here is my lump of Nile mud acting as a link representing
nearly four thousand years between the Christian world of the
present day, and the long-perished Egyptian dynasty of the
Pharaohs.</p>

<p>Now we will pass to the opposite side of the world.</p>

<p>In tropical America, as in tropical Africa, the rivers are
dried up in the summer, and the mud which forms their banks
and bed is baked as hard as that of the Nile and other African
rivers. Many of these rivers are inhabited by a fish (<i>Callicthys</i>)
popularly called the Hassar, or Hardback. The latter
name is given to it in consequence of two rows of hard, narrow
scales on each side of the body. There are four long, flexible
tentacles on the upper lip. It is not nearly so large as the
Lepidosiren, seldom exceeding eight inches in length. Its
color is greenish brown.</p>

<p>Unlike the Lepidosiren, which can not travel on dry ground,
the Hassar is as good a walker as the Climbing Perch, a fish
which not only leaves the water and traverses dry land, but
can ascend the trunk of trees. All rivers have some portions
deeper than others, “holes” as we call them in our rivers at
home. So, when the process of drying up is nearly completed,
the river is converted into a ravine along which “holes” or
pools are seen at irregular distances.</p>

<p>As long as the holes are capable of containing water, the
Hassar makes its way to them over the dry ground. But, in
process of time, even the pools are dried up, and just before
this happens, the Hassar works its way into the mud, and acts
after the manner of the Lepidosiren. The analogy between
the two fishes is made still more remarkable, inasmuch as they
both furnish food to man during the time of Estivation.</p>

<p>The Hassar has a further interest in being one of the few
fishes which make nests and watch over their young. Our
sticklebacks do this, but whereas with the stickleback the
double task of making the nest and guarding the young is relegated
to the male, with the Hassar the latter duty is shared
by the female. It begins the task of nest-making almost as
soon as it escapes from its cocoon, so as to insure plenty of
time for nest-making, egg-hatching, and rearing the young.</p>

<p>The American Alligator, which, like the Hassar, is deprived
of food when the rivers and swamps have been dried, allows
itself to be buried in the mud, and there awaits the return of
rain.</p>

<p>A curious instance of this habit occurred some years ago. A
party of travelers had halted on a piece of hard, level ground,
lighted a fire and began to cook their dinner. But that dinner
was spoiled, for before the cooking was completed the ground
began to heave and swell, and out burst the head of an alligator.
The unfortunate reptile was estivating exactly under the
spot where the fire had been placed, and where it would have
remained asleep until the next rainy season, had it not been
disturbed.—<i>London Sunday Magazine.</i></p>

<h2 id="RECREATION">RECREATION.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By JAMES PAGET.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>There are some rules regarding active recreations which it is
well for all to observe: for all, at least, who must work, or who
wish to work as well as play.</p>

<p>First, recreations should not only be compatible with the
business or duty of life, but absolutely and far subordinate;
and this, not only in kind, but in number and quantity. Their
utility, and, sometimes, even their only justification is that they
may increase the power and readiness for work; beyond this
they should not be allowed to pass.</p>

<p>Then, they should chiefly exercise the powers which are least
used in the work; and this, not only for pleasure but for utility.
For there are few daily occupations which provide sufficient
opportunities for the training of all the powers and dispositions
which may be usefully employed in them and of which the full
use, though not necessary for an average fitness, may be essential
to excellence in the business of life. They, therefore, that
work chiefly with their minds, should refresh themselves chiefly
with the exercise of their muscles; manual workers should
rather rest and have some study, or practice some gentle art,
or strive to invent; or, for one more example, they whose days
are spent in money speculations and excitement had better try
to be happy in passionless thinking, in listening to sweet
sounds, in quiet reading, and so on.</p>

<p>It adds to the utility of every recreation if its events can be often
thought of with pleasure; so that the mind may be sometimes
occupied with them not only in careful thinking, but in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
gaps or casual intervals of time in which, both during and after
work, it is apt to wander uselessly. Especially is this true of
mental recreations; they may thus prolong their happiness and
their utility from day to day or year to year; as often as they
are remembered the mind may be refreshed far more than it is in
the mere vacancy of thought. And there may be as much refreshment
in looking forward; as, for example, in planning a good
holiday, or at the best, in trying, by the light of either faith or
science, to anticipate the final decision of the doubts which
now beset us, or the wonders that will be revealed, or the new
powers that will be exercised in the far distant future.</p>

<p>It is an excellence in recreations if they lead us to occupy
ourselves in pursuits which give opportunities of gaining honest
repute and personal success. Competition is good in all virtuous
pleasures as well as in all work; the habit of being in
earnest and of doing one’s best may be strengthened in recreations,
and then employed in its still better use in work.</p>

<p>And in agreement with this it is a great addition to the happiness
and utility of a recreation if it enables us to do or to
acquire something which we may call our own. In this is a
part of the advantage which any one may find in giving part
of his spare time to some study, some branch of art, some
invention or research which may be recognized, at least among
his friends as being, in some sense, his own. The study itself
must be the first and chief refreshment, but its pleasure is enhanced
if with the knowledge or the skill which it attains there
is mingled some consciousness of personal property.</p>

<p>Similarly, and for a like reason, the happiness of a recreation
is increased if it leads us to collect anything; books, sketches,
shells, autographs, or whatever may be associated with the
studies or the active exercises of spare times or even with those
of business. I think that none who have not tried it can imagine
how great is the refreshment of collecting and of thinking,
at odd moments, of one’s specimens and arranging and displaying
them. There are few good recreations, few daily occupations
with which something of the kind may not be usefully
mingled.</p>

<p>Cricket matches, rowing matches, foot ball, and the like,
are admirable in all the chief constituent qualities of recreations;
but besides this, they may exercise a moral influence of
great value in business or in any daily work. For without any
inducement of a common interest in money, without any low
motive, they bring boys and men to work together; they teach
them to be colleagues in good causes with all who will work fairly
and well with them. They teach that power of working with others
which is among the best powers for success in every condition
of life. And by custom, if not of their very nature, they teach
fairness; foul play in any of them, however sharp may be the
competition, is by consent of all, disgraceful; and they who
have a habit of playing fair will be the more ready to deal fair.
A high standard of honesty in their recreations will help to
make people despise many things which are far within the
limits of the law.</p>

<p>And, for one more general rule, it is an excellent quality in
recreations if they will continue good even in old age. I think
the experience of men would confirm this by the instances they
see of unhappy rich old men who have retired from business
and have no habitual recreations. None seem so unhappy as do
some of these.</p>

<p>They used to enjoy the excitement of uncertainty in their
business; now, everything is safe and dull; then, mere rest
after fatigue was happiness; now, there is no fatigue, but there
is restlessness in monotony; they used to delight in the exercise
of skill and in the counting of its gains; now, the only
thing in which they had any skill is gone; they have no work to
do, and they do not know how either to play or to rest.</p>

<p>It is well, therefore, that all should prepare for the decline of
power in recreations, as well as in much graver things. There
are many that do not lose their charm or their utility as we
grow older. One is in the refreshment of collections; for there
are many whose value constantly increases as they become
older, and with all of them the pleasure is enhanced the further
we can look back in the memory of the events associated
with each specimen, and can recollect the difficulty of obtaining
it, and the joy of first possession. Or, there may be a
change of active recreations; the elderly cricketer may take to
golf and become sure that it is in every way the better of the
two; the old hunting man may ride to cover more cautiously.
Or, with less activity, there may be the happiness of reading or
meditation, of music, or any of the fine arts; these, if they
have been prudently cultivated, do not become wearisome in
old age. If these and other like things fail, it may be a sign
that it is time to leave off work; but so long as a man can work,
so long will he be right if he will spend some of his leisure
times, wisely and actively, in recreations; they may make him
both more fit to do his work, and, at the last, more fit to leave
it.—<i>The Nineteenth Century.</i></p>

<h3>IV.—THE MATHEMATICAL FAILURE.</h3>

<p>We do not often hear those who declare that “education
does not educate,” trying to account for the failure charged
against existing school systems. Are the alleged defects to be
found in the unfit nature of the things studied, or in methods of
study, or both? One of the chief exercises—indeed <i>the</i> chief,
in common schools—depended upon for mental development
is numbers. Is the study of arithmetic worthy the place it
holds in that regard? Does it do more than to cultivate a special
faculty? Is that faculty one of the most important in the
human mind? Is it related intimately to understanding, and
does its culture imply a stimulation of the reasoning powers?</p>

<p>Answers to these questions would doubtless be colored by
the mental characteristics or experience of the individual
answering. To some minds mathematics is a general stimulant;
to others only a useful tool; to still others, a stumbling
block and an offense. Some one has declared that while all
specialties followed exclusively, are narrowing in their influence
on the mind, the two specialties which lead straightest toward
imbecility are music and mathematics. This was probably the
conclusion of a mind which could not master the extraction of
the cube root, and did not know “Yankee Doodle” from “Old
Hundred.” Oliver Goldsmith said “Mathematics is a study to
which the meanest intellect is competent.” He remembered
many floggings because of the multiplication table, and hardly
had patience to count change for a sovereign. If we appeal
to first-rate examples of achievement in music and mathematics—say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
to a Mozart and a Newton—we shall find well-balanced
minds; but on the other hand we may be confounded
by finding prodigies in these lines who possess mean intellects
otherwise. Blind Tom and Zerah Colburn are
illustrations. Zerah Colburn had mathematics in “the
natural way.” His parents in Vermont were poor and
ignorant; the father appears to have been both selfish
and stupid, but the mother was rather a shrewd Yankee
woman. If there was any special gift in the family it was for
hard work and sharp trading—rather commonplace gifts in
New England. Out of this unpromising stock came Zerah in
1804. One day, when he was six years old, he flashed out a
mathematical meteor, a revelation. His father overheard him
reciting in his play the multiplication table, having never
learned it. Examination showed that he knew it all and more
too; was, in fact, himself a walking, frisking multiplication
table. He answered instantly the product of 13×97—1261.
The gift seemed to have descended on him then and there
miraculously; the fact probably was that it had always been
there, but he had been too dull to exercise it until the whim
struck the little animal.</p>

<p>The event created a sensation, which, inside of a year, was
felt both in America and Europe. The popular wonder with
which the child’s performance was received very speedily
turned the head of his stupidly cunning father; he dropped his
farm tools and rejecting all the offers of wealthy gentlemen to
give the boy a complete education, set out to exhibit the prodigy
through the land as a show. Thereafter, so long as both
lived, the father was the evil genius of the son.</p>

<p>At the outset of their wanderings, President Wheelock, of
Dartmouth College, offered to take the child and give him a
thorough education, but the father declined the offer, not including
even a honorarium for himself. In Boston a committee
of wealthy gentlemen, headed by Josiah Quincy, offered to
raise $5,000, one-half to be given to the father, the other moiety
to be devoted to Zerah’s education, under their direction. The
father acceded to this, but for some reason, when the contract
of indenture was drawn, it was different in the important particular
that the father and son were to be <i>permitted</i> to exhibit
the lad publicly until the proceeds should amount to $5,000,
when the sum was to be apportioned as before stipulated.
This arrangement the father very properly rejected, and the
negotiations failed. Wrong versions of this affair were published,
imputing to the father the rejection of the genuine
benefaction first proposed. That these reports injured him and
their success thereafter wherever they went, the son always
asseverated.</p>

<p>They now went on “a starring tour” through the country,
meeting with varied success, and in the early spring of 1811
returned to Vermont with about $600 as the proceeds thereof.
The elder Colburn gave $500 of this to the mother, which, for the
next twelve years, was all he contributed to the family support—the
family then consisting of six children under fourteen
years of age.</p>

<p>From the first Zerah’s performance was confounding to all
spectators. Mathematically, nothing seemed impossible to this
child of six years. Being asked, “What is the number of seconds
in 2,000 years?” he readily and accurately answered
63,072,000,000. Again, “What is the square of 1,449,” he
answered, 2,099,601. More intricate calculations based on
concrete facts, were equally easy, as “Suppose I have a corn-field
in which are seven acres, having seventeen rows to each
acre, sixty-four hills to each row, eight ears on a hill, and one
hundred and fifty kernels on each ear, how many kernels in
the corn-field?” The answer, 9,139,200 kernels, came readily.
Asked what sum multiplied by itself will produce 998,001, he
replied in four seconds, 999; and in twenty seconds produced
the correct answer to “How many days and hours have
lapsed since the Christian era began?” viz.: 661,015 days,
15,864,360 hours. He gave the answer to this: What is the
square of 999,999×49×25; the answer requires seventeen figures
to express it. Being asked what are the factors of 247,483 he
made this reply: “941 and 263, and these are the <i>only</i> factors.”
How could he know that?</p>

<p>These operations seemed the automatic action of mental power
allied to instinct rather than to reason. The child had had
absolutely no education in numbers and could neither read
nor write; he would scarcely interrupt his infantile play to
make his calculations. It was not till the spring of 1811 that
he learned the names and the powers of the nine digits when
written, and this he learned from a stranger who seemed to
take this much more interest in his education than his father
had ever taken. He was at this time a bright, playful, healthy
boy. He answered mere puzzling questions with more than
the ordinary shrewdness of his age, as, “Which is the greater,
six dozen dozen or half a dozen dozen?” “Which is greater,
twice twenty-five or twice five-and-twenty?” “How many
black beans make six white ones?” He answered quickly,
“Six—if you skin ’em.” During his calculations he would
twist and contort like one in St. Vitus’ dance. If asked, as he
often was, his method of calculation, he would cry at the annoyance
of attempting to explain.</p>

<p>In April, 1811, father and son went to England, the child
then being six and a half years old. The father tried (in vain,
of course) to induce his wife to put their five little ones out in
care of the neighbors and go abroad with him! Then, as at
all other times, she seems to have monopolized the wit of the
family. The same one-sidedness may have been detected in
other families, for aught I know to the contrary.</p>

<p>In England he at first created a marked sensation. His
receptions were attended by wondering multitudes, among
them being members of the nobility and royal family and distinguished
scientists and literati. Among his achievements at
this time was to multiply the number eight by itself up to the
sixteenth power, giving the inconceivable result, 281,474,976,710,656.
He extracted the square and cube roots of large numbers
by a flash of his genius. It had been laid down by mathematicians
that no rule existed for finding the factors of
numbers, but at the age of nine Zerah made such a rule; it was
nearly as difficult to understand as his performance, however.
Under this formula he gave the factors of 171,395, viz.:
5×34279; 7×22485; 59×2905; 83×2065; 35×4897; 295×581;
413×415. “It had been asserted,” he says, “by a French
mathematician that 4294967297 is a prime number; but the celebrated
Euler detected the error by discovering that it is equal
to 641×6,700,417. The same number was proposed to this child,
who found out the factors by the mere operation of his mind.”</p>

<p>The father was now happy. He was in the enjoyment of
means and distinction through his child, all of which, with the
usual conceit of a father, he arrogated to himself as the due
reward of merit for having been the prodigious progenitor of so
remarkable a child. Various money-making enterprises were
started in connection with the “show,” from which others
seemed to derive as much benefit as the father. Sir James
Mackintosh, Sir Humphrey Davy (inventor of the safety lamp)
and Basil Montague became a committee to superintend the
publication of a book about the child; but though several hundred
subscribers were obtained, many of whom paid in advance,
the work was never published. A meeting of distinguished
gentlemen was held to devise a scheme for his special
education, which should develop his genius into a prodigy of
matured intellectual powers, such as the world had never conceived.
But all these plans were defeated by two circumstances—the
boy’s general incapacity and the father’s special
rapacity.</p>

<p>The “show business” seemed to be the elder Colburn’s forté
and he took the boy on exhibition to Scotland and Ireland, and
finally to Paris (1814). Here, too, the extraordinary interest in
his extraordinary faculty resulted in a project for his proper
education—La Place, the author of “Méchanique Celeste,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Guizot, the historian, being conspicuous in his interest. It resulted
in his being given a scholarship in the Lyceum by order
of Napoleon, just then back from Elba on his little excursion
to re-resubjugate the world; this intervention in behalf of the
boy being one creditable act of his brief restoration, at least.
The lad showed his gratitude to his imperial patron by ardently
assisting in the entrenchments thrown up to resist the attack
of the allied armies on Paris after the defeat at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The London admirers, spurred by pique at the French interest
in and control of the boy, and by the father’s importunities,
set about raising a purse to bring Zerah back and educate him
in England. In furtherance of the enterprise, the father took
his boy from the Lyceum and brought him to London in
February, 1816. But this scheme fell through, owing, it is
charged, to dissatisfaction with the father’s demand of a large
endowment to himself as well as for the child; and soon both
were living in poverty, unheeded and deserted.</p>

<p>In a fortunate moment the Earl of Bristol interested himself
in young Colburn and made a provision of $620 a year for his
education at Westminster school, where he was regularly
entered, being then a few days over twelve years old. Here he
spent two years and nine months. Though he made creditable
progress in languages he disappointed those who had built
expectations on his peculiar powers, by revolting against higher
mathematics. It was found, in fact, that his special faculty
was less susceptible of discipline than is the ordinary mathematical
power of other youth.</p>

<p>But, I am gratified to state, the young Yankee made a stubborn
resistance to the British form of white slavery in the
school known as “fagging;” and what with his own obstinacy
and the old man’s constant harassing the school authorities
with remonstrances, the rule was suspended in the case of
Zerah—probably the first and last case of such an alarming
innovation on good old brutal British customs. Having won
this emancipation the old father submitted with equanimity to
being hooted off the “campus” with cries of “Yankee.”</p>

<p>But the elder Colburn next quarreled with his generous patron,
and took the boy from school. We may venture to doubt
if this was after all a great privation to the lad. The curriculum
of Westminster school the first four years consisted of
Latin and fagging; the next four years of Greek and fagging.
They had made it elective in Zerah’s case to the extent of
omitting the fagging, taking away the live part of the curriculum
and leaving him only the dead. Zerah himself tells us
that the same time which was thus spent in linguistic body-snatching
if spent in the French seminary would have afforded
an excellent general education. This fatuity regarding dead
languages has been since well maintained in English high
schools and colleges, and, what is more remarkable, has been
pretty faithfully imitated in higher institutions in America.</p>

<p>Thrown on their own resources again, they found the novelty
of Zerah’s performance had worn off, and he did not
“draw.” The father now conceived the brilliant plan of making
an actor of the boy. After four months’ training by Kemble,
he appeared on the stage at Margate, with a little success;
went with strolling companies through England and Ireland
during four months more, and then returned to London and
ended the histrionic career. Next Zerah was prompted by the
fond father to attempt play-writing, but as he says himself, his
compositions “never had any merit or any success”—though
this is substantially his opinion of all his own efforts through life.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
Extreme poverty followed, almost the only means of subsistence
being genteel begging from former friends. The last and
kindest of these was at length worn out, and directed his footman
to slam the door in the poor boy’s face when he presented
himself on some alleged errand from his father.</p>

<p>Zerah in his autobiography, subsequently written, speaks of
these dark days with sorrow, but without one word of complaint
of his father; indeed, the memoir seems to have been
written more for the purpose of vindicating the father’s name
than to do himself justice. He constantly laments that the
mysterious faculty had been given him, and attributes to it and
to his own general incapacity, all the misfortunes and sufferings
of his father and himself. He called his gift “a peculiarly
painful circumstance which destroyed all pleasing anticipations,
blasted every prospect of social happiness, and after
years of absence consigned the husband and father to a stranger’s
grave.” Poor boy! He must have suffered more than
he confesses. He hints at their want, his disgust with asking
charity, the alienation of friends, and, above all his afflictions,
he chafes at his idleness; and he naively sums up the whole
experience as one of “comparative unhappiness!” How did
Dickens ever miss these unique studies from real life?</p>

<p>A situation as usher in a school was now obtained for young
Zerah (ætat 17) and he soon after set up a school on his own
account. This was probably the first legitimate money he ever
earned, and he mentions the chance, poor as it was, with more
satisfaction than he does any of the achievements of his genius.
It was far better than depending on patronage—which seems
to have galled his pride. Before anything could come of
school teaching, however, the father and son went off to other
cities on a begging expedition. The usual humiliation and
misery followed the undertaking, and they returned to London,
where the young man reopened his school. Here, in 1824, his
father died of consumption brought on by want and anxiety.
One of Zerah’s biographers has said of the father: “Unhappily
he had from the first discovery of his son’s extraordinary
gifts, worked upon them with mercenary feelings, as a source
of revenue. It is true he had a father’s love for his child, and
in this respect Zerah, in the simple memoir of his own life, does
his parent more than justice; but still it was this short-sighted
selfishness which made him convert his child’s endowments
into a curse to him, to his friends, and to Zerah himself. His
expectations had been lifted to such a pitch that nothing could
satisfy them. The most generous offers fell short of what he
felt to be his due; liberality was turned in his mind to parsimony,
and even his friends were regarded as little short of enemies.
Such a struggle could not always last. His mind was
torn with thoughts of his home and family, neglected for twelve
years; of his life wasted, his prospects defeated; of fond
dreams ending at last in failure, shame, and poverty.”</p>

<p>After the death of his father, Zerah’s course of life was not
less vacillating and unsuccessful, however, so it seems that his
failures were not altogether due to his father’s bad counsels.
He remained a while in London, making astronomical calculations
and doing other mathematical work, as chance offered
it. Aided by his old benefactor, Lord Bristol, he at last set out
to seek his mother and family. She had done better alone.
“During the long absence of her husband, with a family of
eight children, and almost entirely destitute of property, she
had sustained the burthen with indomitable energy. She
wrought with her own hands in house and field; bargained
away the little farm for a better one; and as her son says, ‘by
a course of persevering industry, hard fare and trials such as
few women are accustomed to, she has hitherto succeeded in
supporting herself, beside doing a good deal for her children.’”
Lucky for the family that one of them was not a genius. Mathematics,
however, seems to be a form of monomania from
which her sex is generally exempt. In fact, in the long list of
eccentric Americans from which I can choose subjects for this
series of sketches, I fear there is not to be one eccentric
woman. This can be taken as complimentary to the sex or
not, according as the reader regards eccentricity.</p>

<p>Our arithmetical prodigy, now twenty years old, went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
teaching a country school for a living, and at last fetched up in
that other safe retreat of preaching the gospel. He followed this
vocation with more persistence and credit than he had brought
to any other of his numerous professions, though on his own
modest representation he was not much of a preacher. His
last venture was to become professor of—not mathematics—but
languages in the “Vermont University” at Norwich. In
this situation his life terminated, March 2, 1840. He plaintively,
but in a somewhat pedantic style, sums up his career as
follows:</p>

<p>“Perhaps it has fallen to the lot of very few, if any individuals,
while attracting curiosity and notice, to receive at the
same time so many flattering marks of kindness, and it is not
unfrequently a sorrowful reflection to him that after all the
sympathy and benevolence shown by the liberal and scientific,
certain unforeseen and unfortunate causes have prevented and
still prevent his reaching and sustaining that distinguished
place in the mathematical literature of the age to which, on
account of the singular gift bestowed on him, he seemed to be
destined. Now, after possessing that talent twenty-two years,
he feels unable to account for its donation, and is unaware of
its object.”</p>

<p>Some facts regarding this singular gift may furnish suggestions
to those who think upon educational matters.</p>

<p>1. His peculiar faculty was <i>arithmetical</i>, not generally mathematical.
He had little or no taste for higher mathematics:
those which, like geometry and surveying, appeal to the perceptions,
those which, like algebra, appeal to the imagination,
and those which, like pure mathematics, appeal to the analytical
reasoning powers, he disliked. His gift was natural,
rudimentary and unreasoning, and as he reached adult life it
passed from him, either because he outgrew it or lost it by over-use
or disuse. Constant and long continued practice in mental
calculation brought the possessor of this special mathematical
gift, as he says, neither intellectual growth nor better capacity
for mental application. In fact, the more he used it the stupider
he grew.</p>

<p>May we infer from this that arithmetic is a primitive, rudimentary
and low branch of mathematics, having little or no relation
to the perceptions of childhood, the imagination of youth
and the reasoning powers of the matured mind, and hence of
little or no value for the purpose of mental exercise and stimulation?</p>

<p>2. His whole process was that of <i>multiplication</i>, and its
inversion (division). He seems not to have practiced addition,
which is in reality the rudiments of multiplication, or its
converse, subtraction, which is only the long process of
division. In the multiplication of large numbers, which so
astounded people, he performed mentally several operations to
get the result.</p>

<p>May we infer from this analysis—arithmetic being assumed
to be the most unintellectual form of mathematics—that multiplication
is the least valuable part of arithmetic?</p>

<p>If psychologists should grant these inferences to be sound, it
remains the duty of teachers to address themselves to improving
the teaching of the multiplication table, as the weak spot in
all our primary education in numbers. Something can be done,
perhaps, to idealize the multiplication table, and to make instruction
in it concrete, objective, rational. Can not a child be
shown why or how six times seven make forty-two? If arithmetic
is so abstract, arbitrary and barren of ideas that this can
not be done, were it not better to cease compelling the miniature
mind to repeat year after year such stale and silly truisms
as, “twice two are four,” etc., under the absurd expectation
that some prodigious mental outburst must result from it in
some mysterious manner? Why not substitute for this endless
repetition “Eiry eiry, ickery Ann, fillisy follisy, Nicholas John,”
to accomplish the same result?</p>

<p>Some good teachers, here and there, are working on the problem
of how to make arithmetic educational as well as useful.
A person who has lively recollections of days and weeks and
months wasted on the dead-lift of memorizing the multiplication
table, as an achievement by the side of which all subsequent
labors of life were easy, will find comfort in the perfect
uselessness of Colburn’s wonderful genius for multiplication
without effort.</p>

<p>But it <i>was</i> a wonderful faculty. What if a man were born
with <i>all</i> his faculties expanded to the same degree! Shall education
and inherited progress yet produce minds as nearly infinite
in every power as Zerah Colburn’s was in one? Is there,
<i>is</i> there an educational method which can take the shackles off
all the faculties?</p>

<p>If not, may there be somewhere a life in which the mind, let
out of the strait earthly house of its tabernacle and freed
from the sore limitations of physical nature may reach that
acme in all its functions? Some of the operations of mind in
a condition of suspended physical existence seem to suggest
this as a probability for even common-place natures, as occasionally
do such splendid exhibitions of a single faculty in so
weak a nature as Zerah Colburn’s.</p>

to the yet unpublished and unwritten memoir of the lad. As he had by this
time been able to formulate the method by which he made his mental computations,
the father advertised to impart the secret of Zerah’s mysterious power to any one
who would subscribe for ten copies of the memoir at eight dollars the copy.</p>

<h3>THE SUN,</h3>

<p class="unindent">As is evidenced by the continually lengthening days, is making
its way northward. On the first it rises at 7:10 and sets at
5:18; on the 15th, rises at 6:54 and sets at 5:34; and on the
29th, rises at 6:35 and sets at 5:51, giving from the 1st to the
29th of the month an increase of one hour and eight minutes.
The sun is “slow” during the entire month; that is, it does
not reach the meridian until after noon; for example, on the
1st, when the sun is on the meridian, a good time-piece says it
is about fourteen minutes after noon. On the 1st, day breaks
at 5:32, and evening twilight ends at 6:56.</p>

<h3>THE MOON.</h3>

<p>On the 4th, at 12:49 a. m., the moon enters her first quarter;
on the 10th, at 11:40 p. m., is full; on the 18th, at 10:04 p. m.,
enters her last quarter; and on the 26th, at 1:27, is again new.
On the 1st, 15th and 29th respectively, she reaches the meridian
at 3:55 p. m., 3:14 a. m., and 2:41 p. m. She is nearest
to the earth at 3:54 on the evening of the 4th, and most distant
at twelve minutes after three on the morning of the 18th. She
reaches her greatest elevation, 67° 31′ latitude 41° 30′, on
the 6th.</p>

<h3>MERCURY.</h3>

<p>Only early risers need expect to see Mercury this month, as
he is a morning star, rising as follows: On the 1st at 5:54 a. m.;
on the 13th, on which day also he reaches his greatest western
elongation (26° 12′), at 5:41 a. m., or about 76 minutes before
sunrise, and on the 29th at 5:49 a. m. On the 26th, at 7:00 a. m.,
he is farthest from the sun. His diameter diminishes from
8.4″ on the 1st to 5.6″ on the 29th.</p>

<h3>VENUS,</h3>

<p class="unindent">As intimated last month, continues to be an evening star, making
every evening an increasingly handsome display in the
western heavens, her diameter growing from 12.8″ on the 1st
to 14.6″ on the 29th. Her motion, which is from west to east,
amounts during the month to 31° 51′ 37″ of arc. Her time of
setting, on the 1st, 15th and 29th, is as follows: 7:54, 8:26 and
8:57 p. m., respectively. On the 29th, at 10:07 a. m., she will
be in conjunction with, and 32′ south of the moon.</p>

<h3>MARS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will present nothing particularly new. His retrograde motion
still continuing, he will rise earlier each evening, and, of
course, set earlier the following morning. Thus, on the 1st,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he rises at 4:51 p. m.; on the 15th, at 3:35 p. m.; and on the
29th, at 2:23 p. m. He sets on the mornings immediately following
these dates at 7:29, 6:23 and 5:15; or, on the first date
about twenty minutes after, and on the latter date about one
hour and twenty minutes before sunrise; during the month
taking his place as an evening star. His motion amounts to
9° 7′ 11″ of arc, and as he is going farther from the earth, his
diameter grows smaller, being 15″ on the first, and only 13.2″
on the last of the month. On the 10th, at 4:40 a. m., he is 9°
43′ north of the moon, and a little east of the nebula <i>Præsepe</i>
in <i>Cancer</i>.</p>

<h3>JUPITER</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will be evening star throughout the month, and continue his
retrograde motion from a point about twenty minutes west of
<i>Præsepe</i> on the 1st, to 7 hours 48 minutes 35 seconds right
ascension on the 29th. He will rise on the 1st at 3:56; on the
15th at 2:53; and on the 29th at 1:52 p. m., and will set on the
2d at 6:30; on the 16th at 5:29; and on March 1st at 4:30 a. m.
On the 9th, at 5:39 a. m., he will be 5° 45′ north of the moon.
Of the four satellites, or moons, revolving around Jupiter, three
are so near as to be eclipsed by him at each revolution. Roemer,
a Danish astronomer, observed, however, that when the
earth and Jupiter were on opposite sides of the sun, these
eclipses occurred, as he estimated, about twenty-two minutes
later than the time predicted by the tables. As the earth in
this position was some one hundred and eighty-six millions of
miles farther away from Jupiter than when Jupiter and the
earth were on the same side of the sun, the discovery was made
that the discrepancy in time was occasioned by the fact that
light must have time to travel; and later and more accurate
investigations afford us the truth that it takes light sixteen
minutes and forty seconds to cross the earth’s orbit, or eight
minutes and twenty seconds to come from the sun to the earth;
and hence, that it travels about 180,000 miles per second.
These eclipses occur frequently every month, and can be observed
with telescopes of quite moderate power.</p>

<h3>SATURN.</h3>

<p>This planet will be evening star throughout the month, setting
as follows: On the 2d, at 2:28 a. m.; on the 16th, at 1:33 a. m.;
and on the 29th, at 12:41 a. m. Its direct motion amounts to
41′ 32.1″ of arc. On the 3d, at 9 a. m., it is stationary. On
the 5th, at 7:34 a. m., 1° 18′ north of the moon. On the 22d,
at noon, it is “quartile,” being 90° east of the sun. It can be
found near the <i>Hyades</i>, a little north, at any time this month.
Its diameter decreases from 18″ on the 1st, to 17.2″ on the
29th.</p>

<h3>URANUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Makes a retrograde motion of 55′ 47.1″, and retains the same
diameter, namely, 3.8″. It will be morning star, rising however,
early enough to be viewed in the evening. For example,
on the 1st, at 9:00 p. m.; on the 15th, at 8:02 p. m.; and on the
29th, at 7:04 p. m. It will set as follows: On the 2d, at 9:10 a.
m.; on the 16th, at 8:14 a. m.; and on the 29th, at 7:18 a. m.
On the 13th, at 7:44 p. m., it will be 3° 18′ north of the moon.
On the 29th can be found nearly on a line between <i>Beta</i> and
<i>Eta</i> in the constellation <i>Virgo</i>, and from <i>Beta</i> about one-third
of the distance between these two stars.</p>

<h3>NEPTUNE</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will be evening star during the month, rising on the 1st at
11:24 in the forenoon, and setting next morning at 1:14; on the
15th, rising at 10:29 a. m., and setting on the 16th at 12:19 a.
m.; and on the 29th, rising at 9:35 a. m., and setting at 11:25
the same evening. Its diameter is 2.6″. Motion direct,
amounting to 16′ 56″ of arc. On the 4th, at 6:33 a. m., is 11′
north of the moon; and on the 7th, at 9 a. m., is 90° east of the
sun. Rises about forty-eight minutes earlier than Saturn.</p>

<p class="center">A lecture delivered at the Monterey Assembly, Pacific Grove Retreat, California,
1883.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It is said of Milton that in two short lines of poetry he made
four mistakes in Natural History. He said of a whale:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“At his gills takes in,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And at his trunk lets out a sea.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, in the first place, the whale has no gills; second, he
takes in air instead of water; third, he throws out expired air;
fourth, the water “spouted” is thrown up by the force of expiration,
not out of the animal’s body, but water that may lie
between the “blow-hole” and the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>I am not so sure but Milton made more than four mistakes
in these lines. For whoever starts out on a wrong premise
will follow a line of mistakes continually. Nevertheless, mistakes
attentively observed may be profitable. We learn by
mistakes. Unsuccessful experiments are mistakes of a kind—something
wrong in the formula. The first aquarium I tried to
start I made more mistakes than Milton made in his two lines.
I made mistakes the second trial, and the third, and a dozen
more times. And when I have succeeded in some instances,
it was by accident, and to-day I can not tell why I sometimes
failed, or why I sometimes succeeded. I have the consolation,
however, of company in this respect. One of the most successful
managers of aquaria says that he would give very
much if he knew how to grow some of the higher marine algæ
as one grows plants in a garden. Occasionally he has succeeded,
but he confesses it was not by skill, but by chance.</p>

<p>I propose, therefore, that for a little while we consider the
sea as an aquarium—a place adapted to the growth of animals
and plants. Our subject is somewhat large, I must confess,
but if we can see and understand how these things live and grow
in the ocean we must be able to grow them in our parks, and
possibly in our houses. For what Nature does on a grand
scale may also be done in a small way; and principles that
govern the successful growth of plants and animals in a bottle
of sea water must be the same that govern the fauna and flora
of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>In order then to study and understand these things it will not
be entirely necessary to make a trip to the equator, to the poles,
or to travel around the world.</p>

<p>It has been a favorite theory with Henry D. Thoreau and
John Burroughs, those genial and poetical lovers and observers
of nature, that we need not rove all over the earth, as is the
custom of many, to see this curiosity or that, or to observe nature
in her secret recesses, but that we only have to sit down in
the woods or by the sea-shore, and everything of interest will
come round to us. The little town of Concord was a whole
world in miniature to Thoreau. Everything worth finding
could be found there. And so to John Burroughs, is the juniper
forest of the Hudson, a show case, with the whole world
inside. “Nature,” he says, “comes home to one most when he
is at home; the stranger and traveler finds her a stranger and
a traveler also.”</p>

<p>I think we may infer from this theory of our charming philosophers
rather a poetical interpretation. They would urge a
careful observation and study of phenomena in and near the
places where we live, rather than gadding up and down the
earth in search of novelties. If we familiarize ourselves with
every day common objects and events of plants, animals, and
other operations in nature, we shall then always be at home
when nature calls, whether on one side or the other of the
world.</p>

<p>I have heard of a good old lady who, when nearing the end
of her earthly existence, said she did not mind the dying if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
could only breathe. Now this goodly person had doubtless
spent all the years of her life without observing the fact that
every plant or animal however small or simple in structure
must have, if nothing else, the organs for breathing, and when
that function is suspended or destroyed, life ceases. The respiratory
organs may be reduced to a single cell, wall, or
membrane. The forms of these organs, however, are exceedingly
variable, elaborate, and sometimes complicated.</p>

<p>In the sea, plants and animals have a compensatory relation
to each other. The plant exhales oxygen and the animal exhales
carbon. That is to say, the carbonic acid which is mixed
mechanically with the water coming in contact with the cell,
wall, or membrane, covering the plant, the atom of carbon is
appropriated, freeing the two atoms of oxygen, which in turn
are appropriated by the animal.</p>

<p>Not only is this process of breathing compensatory and reciprocative—an
interchange of commodities—the plant giving
two atoms of oxygen for one of carbon, and the animal bringing
its single but equally valuable atom of carbon for two
atoms of oxygen, but without this interchange, neither could
plant or animal live, and our world of life would become as
dead as the moon is supposed to be.</p>

<p>The process of breathing is so common that we seldom think
about it, unless there is an interference in some way. Each
one of us sitting quietly in this room would breathe about 1000
times in an hour, requiring over 100 gallons of air to sustain the
proper supply of oxygen for the blood. During this time we
have taken from the air a certain amount of oxygen and have
returned to it an equal amount of something else, which we call
carbon oxide, or carbonic acid gas. The oxygen has burned
the effete material which is cast out of the blood in the process
of breathing, and it is returned to the atmosphere as a kind of
coal. The fundamental principle is the same in animals that
breathe water as those that breathe air, only the apparatus is
different. Animals that breathe water have a fine capillary
network of blood-vessels spread out on gills, branchia or projections
arranged so that the water shall pass rapidly over
them, and thus the carbon is carried away and the oxygen
taken into the circulation.</p>

<p>Animals that breathe air through lungs have little air cells,
so very small that a human lung is said to contain 600 millions
of them; and these lie in contact with the capillary circulation
of the lung which receives the oxygen and gives out the carbon.
Some air-breathers have no lungs, but merely spiracles or minute
holes in the body through which the air enters, coming in
contact with the circulation.</p>

<p>In all cases, whatever the form, size, or character of the
animal the object is to bring the air in contact with the circulation
that oxygen may be received in exchange for the burnt
material—the carbon oxide—which, when once formed, is poisonous,
and must be expelled from the animal.</p>

<p>Now if we look over the earth we shall find immense deposits
of coal. Here in the United States we have nearly
200,000 square miles of coal deposits. In other countries there
is a like proportion of these carbon deposits, such as petroleum,
bitumen, and paraffine. Then there are great forests and other
vegetable growth. These have stored up the carbon set free
by the animal, and have kept the air comparatively free from
carbonic acid gas, which but for the vegetables would in a little
while have rendered our atmosphere unfit for animal use.
What is true of the air in this respect is also true of the sea.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about that by the process of breathing, principally,
we have the immense coal fields, the wide spread forests,
and the herbage that covers almost the entire globe. For in
the air and the water there exist the germs of animal and vegetable
life so profusely, so universally, that the proper conditions
of heat and light will develop contemporaneously, both
the organic kingdoms. If we should take ten drops of water
from the middle of the Pacific Ocean, near the surface, and add
them to a small tube, say two ounces, of water that had been
deprived of life by boiling, and kept sealed for a number of
years, and place the tube in favorable conditions, we should
in a few days see a little universe spring, as it were, into existence.
There might not be a great variety of forms, but who
can say that there might not be enough to populate or re-populate
some world just entering into the conditions of such life
as our earth contains, or some other world that had suffered a
reverse, or cataclysm, by which all life was destroyed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd, Superintendent of the Birmingham Aquarium,
says he kept for eight years a bottle of sea water, well corked
and covered with paper, and that when he opened it the water
was perfectly clear, free from smell, and of the same appearance
as when taken from the sea. But when exposed for eight
days to light in a window an abundance of microscopic plants
and animals began to grow, and soon covered the sides of the
bottle, and darted about in the fluid.</p>

<p>Having occasion some ten months ago to use some sea-water,
I brought to my house a demijohn full and placed it on the
north side where the sun seldom shines, and where it is nearly
always cool; although the temperature sometimes goes as high
as 75° and 80° Fahrenheit in the afternoons. There was no particular
effort to exclude light and air; the cork fitted loosely,
and the wicker work was not unusually close. And yet, whenever
I have examined this water it is clear and free from smell,
and there are no plants or animals growing in it. But by exposure
of a small quantity to the light and warmth of a window,
these have rapidly developed. It is a fact, then, easily
demonstrated in our own rooms and houses, that by excluding
light from water and keeping it in a cool place we can arrest
the growth of organisms. This is the case with springs. The
microscope fails to discover germs in spring water until it has
been exposed to the light for some time.</p>

<p>Acting on hints of this kind, Mr. Lloyd has constructed
aquaria with two reservoirs—one in a dark, cool place, quite
large—the other in a light and warm place, favorable to the
growth of plants and animals. By means of pipes these
two reservoirs are connected so that a circulation can be set
up between the light and dark portions. A pump may be used
to force the water from the dark reservoir into the other,
using vulcanite or rubber of some kind for sea water, instead
of such oxidizable metals as brass, tin, lead, etc. The most
convenient temperature is about 60° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Thus, by exchanging the waters of these two reservoirs, as
occasion requires, we shall be able to regulate an aquarium so
as to keep many kinds of plants and animals in a healthy,
growing condition.</p>

<p>The best aquaria are those where the water is never changed,
but ever circulated in the manner I have indicated. Water
that has once been made clear and good, and maintained
plants and animals, is better than any water newly brought
from the sea. It must be remembered that evaporation takes
place from the surface of an aquarium more or less according
to the heat and dryness of the air. At a temperature of 60° in
an ordinary dry air, such as occurs some miles inland, the
evaporation from a surface of water six inches square would be
about three drops in twenty-four hours. Some very warm, dry
days it would be two or three times that much. This waste must
be made up by adding occasionally some distilled water.</p>

<p>An aquarium must be kept free of decaying matter. If once
formed the sooner it is got rid of the better, for it will poison
all creatures that come within its influence. The larger the
dark reservoir the better. It can not be too large, but should
be not less than four or five times larger than the reservoir in
which the plants and animals are kept. Any dead matter then
will quickly be burned at a low temperature—for oxygenation
by means of the dark reservoir means no more nor less than
the burning up of the effete and decaying particles thrown off
by plants and animals.</p>

<p>It might be profitable for me to tell now how I didn’t succeed
with the first aquarium I undertook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a fine, large structure, capable of holding some twenty gallons.
The sea water was procured, and at low tide a friend
went with me to help carry an assortment of plants and animals.
We had read a good deal about the compensatory
properties of these two kingdoms; how the plants exhale oxygen
and inhale carbon, and how the animals inhale oxygen
and exhale carbon, and thus preserve the equilibrium and the
purity of the water. Well, we had good luck in searching tide-pools,
and the turning over of rocks; and we returned loaded
with snails, crabs, sea-anemones, sea-urchins, clams, abelones,
date fish, real fish, sea worms (with beautiful red branchia), and
sea weeds, an extensive variety of red, green and brown, only
one or two of which would grow, as I have since learned, even
in the most successful aquarium yet known. There are many
other things that I have forgotten. We had rock-work and
sand, and pebbles of beautiful colors, and a great many <i>iridea</i>,
a rainbow-colored sea weed. We intended to imitate one of
the beautiful tide-pools we had seen, and astonish our friends
with a little bit of the sea, snatched up and transported to our
quiet room, away from the fog and wind and chill of the ocean
shore. We would willingly have brought the tide and some
waves, if they could have been dwarfed to the dimensions of
our tank. With these and a few other things we might have
succeeded, and kept our aquarium as long as Robert Warrington
kept his in London, with unchanged water, during a
period of eighteen years.</p>

<p>But in eighteen hours our animals were all dead or dying;
and although the plants were in proportion—that is, we had an
equilibrium—they were almost equally in as bad a condition as
the animals. First the water began to turn cloudy. We
looked at our books for light, but they were equally obscure.
Then we perceived a smell, somewhat like canned oysters, and
this smell grew till it permeated the whole house. We suspected
something wrong, so we emptied the aquarium, filtered
the water, threw away the decaying matter, and put the things
in again. But the “muddy vesture of decay” had covered the
stones and entered the crevices, and in a few hours more we
had to cast the contents away. The fact is, as I have learned
since, we had a large number of bruised, broken and bleeding
organisms from the handling in transfer, that the whole ocean’s
waters could not save or heal, much less the little tank of twenty
gallons. There were no waves to carry away the dead matter,
no oxygen in the water to burn it, so it had to be breathed over
and over again until the blood was poisoned and the animal
died, because it could breathe such water no longer. And the
plants began to fade and decay because their blood was also
poisoned.</p>

<p>Now let us turn and consider for a moment Nature’s aquarium—the
sea. It covers two-thirds of the earth’s surface, and
it has been explored to the depth of eight miles at places, without
finding bottom. The average depth, however, is about 2½
miles. All this immense mass of salt water is inhabited with a
fauna and flora in a state of nature. That is, the hand of man
has done nothing in the way of taming or cultivating them.
They are absolutely wild, whilst a large part of the earth is
subject to man’s dominion, and he was commanded to subdue
it. The herbs and the trees of the field “shall be for meat,”
and his “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air,” pronounced at creation, is, as yet, but partially
accomplished. The sea and the air remain as mysteries unsolved,
and as powers unconquered. The cyclone and the
tidal wave are evidences of the untamableness of these elements.
“He bindeth up the waters in thick clouds, and the
cloud is not rent under them,” was the language of some
thirty-five centuries ago, and it is equally as true and expressive
to-day.</p>

<p>Although the sea is inhabited at all depths, according to the
best knowledge we have at present much the largest part lies
beyond daylight. Light only penetrates a few fathoms—all
below is darkness. This is the great, deep, cool reservoir from
which the upper strata is constantly renewed by a circulation
about which we, as yet, know but little. How is this circulation
kept up? Who has charge of “the doors of the sea?” Who
has “entered into the springs of the sea,” or “walked in search
of the depth?” We have some knowledge in regard to these
questions. The investigations of such men as Edward
Forbes, Sir William Thompson, Dr. Wm. B. Carpenter, Lieut.
M. F. Maury, Darwin, Kane, and a host of other scientific explorers
equally as wise and industrious, have solved many mysteries
in regard to the great ocean of salt water, and that lighter
ocean of air that surrounds the earth.</p>

<p>Many years ago Maury wrote some striking and impressive
sentences in his “Physical Geography of Sea,” such as the
following:</p>

<p>“Our planet is invested with two great oceans; one visible,
the other invisible; one underfoot, the other overhead; one
entirely envelops it, the other covers about two-thirds of its surface.
All the water of the one weighs about four hundred
times as much as all the air of the other.”</p>

<p>Then again in reference to the Gulf Stream he says: “There
is a river in the ocean; in the severest droughts it never fails;
in the mightiest floods it never overflows; its banks and its
bottom are of cold water, while its current is of warm. The Gulf
of Mexico is its fountain, and its mouth is in the Arctic Seas.
Its current is more rapid than the Mississippi or the Amazon,
and its volume more than a thousand times greater. Its waters
are of an indigo blue. They are so distinctly marked that their
line of junction with the common sea water may be traced by
the eye. Often one-half of the vessel may be perceived floating
in Gulf Stream water, while the other half is in common
water of the sea, so sharp is the line and such the want of affinity
between those waters, and such, too, the reluctance, so
to speak, on the part of those of the Gulf Stream to mingle with
the littoral waters of the sea.”</p>

<p>We have all read and doubtless thought a great deal about
this wonderful stream; how England and the shores of the
continent are warmed by this water. But there are other
streams equally important, if not so distinctly marked. Every
ocean and sea has its current or currents. As the waters are
warmed by the rays of the sun, they expand and flow away.
But these streams are not very deep, and the Gulf Stream is
shallow compared with the dark, cold current that moves below
it, but in an opposite direction.</p>

<h2 id="SPECULATION_IN_BUSINESS">SPECULATION IN BUSINESS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By JONATHAN.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>As a commercial term the word which heads this article
stands for one of the marked tendencies of the times. Speculation
is not a new thing. Words in the book of Proverbs
suggest that the practice may have been rife twenty-five hundred
years ago. “He that maketh haste to be rich shall not
be innocent,” said the wise king; and it was his testimony that,
even then, there was “nothing new under the sun.” But it is safe
to say that seldom in history has a spirit of speculation so potent
and wide-spread appeared among a people as in our own land
in recent years. We often advert to a period in France. It was
when John Law deluded himself, was deluding the people with his
gigantic financial schemes. The “Mississippi Bubble” arose
before the eyes of men, a fascinating thing, and grew larger
and larger. Then everybody seemed seized with the fever of
speculation. In 1719 it reached its height. All France was in
a ferment, and every one bent on getting speedily rich. From
all parts of the kingdom, and from other countries, people
crowded into Paris to speculate in the enterprises of Law, who
was the idol of the populace, with more than regal power. The
disastrous results to the French nation flowing from the popular
mania of that day are a matter of history, whose lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
may be pondered. Our country has seen no epoch which could
match that in France of over a century and a half ago. There
has been here no equal national convulsion resulting from the
same cause. But the spirit of speculation to-day is in the air
all over the land. We have seen it grow and widen; we have
seen communities agitated by it, and suffering from its work;
we have seen operations of a speculative nature carried on by
our bold and skillful men of affairs, whose magnitude would
have astounded the fathers; and mischievous consequences of
speculation we have seen which were felt in every part of our
country. Bishop Butler’s idea that insanity is not only an
affliction of individuals, but likewise at times of communities,
has abundance of historical facts to stand upon. It is hardly
exaggeration to say there have been times when certain of our
communities were beside themselves with the mania of speculation.
The time was, and not very long ago, when a millionaire
in America was almost unknown; now men with a million of
money are common enough, and those with their hundred millions
are likely soon to be so. These great fortunes, we understand,
were acquired for the most part by fortunate speculation.
This new western world has presented such a field for speculation
as was never known elsewhere, and of the multitudes who
have entered it, some have had success.</p>

<p>The word speculation is a broad one, and covers an immense
class of transactions. It may do, for a general definition, to
say that it means the risking of money with the hope of gain.
The element of contingency enters into all veritable speculation.
The speculator assumes a risk; he makes a venture; he
takes a chance. He may be entirely confident of gaining, but
there is a possibility of his losing. The man who buys a piece
of real estate, or any commodity, expecting that it will rise
in value and he will make money by selling at a higher
figure, speculates. The man who invests money in some undeveloped
enterprise, believing it will prove a “bonanza,” speculates.
The man who, in our stock and produce exchanges,
deals in “futures,” and “options,” and “margins,” calculating
upon a contingent rise or fall in the market to return him
the amount of his venture increased, speculates. The man who
risks his money in “pools” at the horse race or rowing match,
hoping to double it, the man who tries his luck on the gaming
table, hoping to win, speculates. In making this classification,
however, the writer would not, of course, be understood as
making these different transactions named in a moral point of
view the same. Distinctions will presently be made which it is
hoped to the reader’s mind will be clear.</p>

<p>The great arena of operations in the line of speculation in
our land is found in the Exchanges and Boards of Trade of the
cities. These have become numerous, and of various kinds,
and the growth of some of them has been prodigious. We now
have stock exchanges and produce exchanges, cotton exchanges
and oil exchanges and coffee exchanges. Thirty
years ago the Chicago Board of Trade was just making a beginning,
and feeble enough it was at the start. It is now by far
the greatest exchange for produce in the world, and in the year
1882 not less than three billion dollars’ worth of business was
here transacted. A seat in the New York Stock Exchange costs
thirty thousand dollars; and it has been shown that the yearly
transactions of this wonderful mart, represented in dollars and
cents, are but little less than three times “the taxable valuation
of all the personal property in the United States.” Our
exchanges have become marts of speculation. The business
now done in them, aside from that which falls properly into the
speculative class, is inconsiderable. They are not, simply or
chiefly, places to which producers bring their products for sale,
and where men buy commodities, and sell at a fixed advance,
which pays for the trouble of handling them. For the most
part, those who trade here buy and sell calculating upon a rise
or fall in the market which shall yield them a gain. Their gain
is a contingent matter; they run the risk of a loss. This is
speculation. It is a fact well understood that, in by far the
greater part of the transactions in our exchanges, there is no
veritable buying and selling of merchandise, the buyer paying
the price demanded and receiving his purchase. The buyer
neither pays for nor receives his purchase. His purchase is not
a purchase. With a hundred or two dollars he buys merchandise
to the value of thousands. The fact is, he
pays, not for the commodity, but for a chance to make money
from a rise in the price of the same; and his money goes to
insure the one through whom he operates against loss from fluctuations
in the market. On the other hand, the sale of the
seller is not a sale. He sells what he has never seen and never
bought. It is a chance he sells; and if fortune has favored
him, he receives the difference between the price of the commodity
at the time of buying and the time of selling. This is
speculation, and something more. To one who had just come
out of a Rip Van Winkle sleep and knew nothing of customs
which in recent years have come into being in our land, there
are things which would be decidedly puzzling. The present
production of petroleum is estimated at about sixty thousand
barrels a day; but in the different oil exchanges of the country
nearly one hundred times this amount is daily bought and sold.
Our farmers all together produce only one-fifth the number
of bushels of grain per year as reported as changing hands in
the Chicago Board of Trade; and the hogs of trade here are
easily twice as many as the whole land affords. In the New
York Stock Exchange stocks and bonds are daily bought and
sold more by a million dollars’ worth than exist; and the statement
has been made that “when the cotton plantations of the
South yielded less than six million bales, the crop on the New
York Cotton Exchange was more than thirty-two millions.” It
was from expressions in the speeches of General Butler upon
finance that we formed the phrase “fiat money;” and it would
seem that fiat wheat, and fiat pork, and fiat cotton, and fiat
stocks, and fiat oil abound in the exchanges of our cities.</p>

<p>It may be well, for the sake of the uninitiated, to attempt an
explanation of certain terms in common use in connection with
modern speculation. A man is “long on the market”—signifies
that his buying has been in excess of his selling. He has
oil, or grain, or whatever the article of merchandise may be,
on hand—though perhaps not in fact; he has bought more
than he has sold. A man “sells short”—means that he sells
more than he has bought; he has an amount of merchandise
to deliver in excess of what he has purchased. The trading in
“options” has played an important part in the transactions of
our exchanges. “Options” are of two kinds; buyers’ options
and sellers’ options. In the case of the former, a man engages
to take at a stipulated price merchandise to a certain amount,
within a specified time; while the seller’s option binds one to
deliver merchandise as aforesaid. The term “futures” in
significance is not essentially different from “options.” “Puts”
and “calls” are speculative terms which have become very
familiar. A person thinks there is to be a decline in the market.
He pays to another a sum agreed upon for the privilege
of “putting” so much of an article in trade, or disposing of it
to him at a price named, within a certain time—a privilege he
may, or may not use, as he sees fit. Or, he believes the market
will advance; and he pays for the privilege of “calling” or
taking so much merchandise, as aforesaid. Buying and selling
“on margins” is very common. In some exchanges the most
of the business done is of this class. The method is easily
understood. A man wishes to buy for speculation, a thousand
barrels of oil. He pays into his broker’s hands a hundred dollars,
more or less, and the broker buys the oil. The hundred
dollars is a “margin.” The phrase of trade is “putting up
margins.” The margin is the broker’s security. In case the
market falls, and the oil remains on his hands, it secures him
from loss. So much for the vocabulary and methods of speculation.</p>

<p>But there is an aspect of this large question which must not
be passed by. What is to be said of speculation regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
from a moral point of view? Unquestionably there is such a
thing as legitimate speculation—speculation which is not to be
condemned as morally wrong. The man who invests money
in some commodity, paying for and receiving it, with the hope
that he will be the gainer from its rise in value, it is right to
call a speculator, but not right to call an immoral one. But
there is another kind of speculation. A careful consideration
of some of the practices set forth in this article should convince
the candid that, though there are many good men engaged in
them, they can hardly be justified in the light of the moral
law. With regard to the character of gambling there is no
controversy. Every one admits its immorality. And gambling
is a broad genus; its species are many. This excellent definition
has been given of it: “The art or practice of playing a
game of hazard, or one depending partly on skill and partly
on hazard, with a view, more or less exclusive, to a pecuniary
gain.” The old Romans prohibited gambling, not on account of
its immoral character and influence, but because its tendency
was to render the people too effeminate; and for the same cause
at first, laws against gambling were enacted in Great Britain.
But in our own land the law forbids gambling of various forms
because it is felt to be a vice, wrong and demoralizing. We have
laws against lotteries and against betting. These, and other
practices, are generally recognized as species of this vice.
But our courts have decided that other things come under the
same head, as to whose character there is not the same general
consent. By judicial decision the person who takes a chance
in a “grab-bag” at a church fair gambles; and in a most unequivocal
manner, in the courts of different states, the opinion
has been given that certain popular forms of speculation are
gambling. Our judges have repeatedly said that those who
speculate on “margins,” or trade in “options,” and have to
do with “puts” and “calls,” gamble; and it is difficult to see
how the decision can be gainsaid. Some people may be able
easily to see that buying and selling “on margins” is not playing
a game of chance for money; that taking an “option” is
not like buying a ticket in a lottery; and that the method
known as “puts and calls” is not very much the same as betting;
but there are many thinking people who have not the
ability.</p>

<p>Just an allusion may be made to a practice of modern speculation,
of which some one has forcibly and truthfully spoken
as “exaggerated gambling.” It is what is known as “cornering
the market.” Speculators by forming a combination gain a
control of the market, and force it up and down to serve their
own interests. In this way immense fortunes have been made.
The writer’s limits do not allow of his entering into a discussion
of the methods employed. Heartless, cruel, wicked, are
mild terms to apply to this “exaggerated gambling.” It is
true that, by this cornering of the market, men are “squeezed”
and fleeced and ruined who are not themselves scrupulous as
to their methods; but the effects of the pernicious practice often
do not stop with these men. Great corners in grain markets,
by raising the price of bread-stuffs, have resulted in untold
suffering among the poor, and affected in a most unhappy way
the whole country. In 1879 there were two famous corners
which will not soon be forgotten, a corner in wheat, and the
“Armour pork corner.” As a result of these, the price of pork
was more than doubled, flour advanced two dollars a barrel,
and there was a general decided rise in value of the necessaries
of life. Millions of money were made, but the loss to the
country was immense, and the suffering occasioned incalculable.
It was estimated, in a report made to a state legislature, that
the syndicate which manipulated the wheat corner was the
occasion of a loss to the public in different ways of not less than
three hundred millions. As yet there is no punishment by the
law of the enormity of which these cases are illustrations.</p>

<p>A final word can hardly be omitted with regard to the effects
of speculation in general upon those engaged in it, and upon
communities where the spirit is rife. Even those who are so
hardened that they are unable to see that certain peculiar forms
of it are immoral and wrong, as is claimed, will hardly deny
that speculation is a pursuit which is to be censured on other
grounds. The excitement of it is neither physically, mentally,
nor morally healthful. It has a fascination which is dangerous;
to break away from it comes to be like the Ethiopian’s
changing his skin, or the leopard’s his spots. The cases are
sadly frequent where it unfits one for the enjoyment of home,
the pleasures of society, the duties of the citizen and the
Christian. And in a multitude of cases it has brought those
absorbed in it to the mad-house and to an untimely grave.
The judgment of the candid and reflective must be that “making
haste to be rich,” even by ways confessedly proper, is not
best. Moreover, terms too strong can hardly be used in speaking
of the harmful effects upon a community of a spirit of speculation
filling the air. There is seen a feverish condition of things
which is not well. Regular business is neglected; duties are
passed by; the action of others is blindly and rashly followed.
And it is always the case that, sooner or later, to by far the
greater number who give way to the spirit and embark in the
glittering speculative schemes, there comes disaster. Communities
could easily be pointed out in whose condition of prosperity
strikingly reversed one might read: “The demon of
speculation hath done this.”</p>

<h2 id="WINE_AND_WATER">WINE AND WATER.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By BENJAMIN W. RICHARDSON, M.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>What has science said and what is she saying in more
modern times on the question of fact in relation to strong drink
and its effect on the world of life? Let us take some of her
more salient teachings first.</p>

<p>In the year 1725 she spoke to the government of this country,
stating that “the fatal effect of the frequent use of several
sorts of distilled spirituous liquors upon great numbers of both
sexes is to render them diseased, not fit for business, poor, a
burthen to themselves and neighbors, and too often the cause
of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be, instead
of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country.”
Twenty-nine years later, she spoke again through the mouth
of one of her most approved servants, the first inventor of ventilators,
Dr. Stephen Hales. Through this illustrious philosopher
she explained that strong liquors, though called spirituous,
are so far from refreshing and recruiting the spirits, that, on
the contrary, they do, in reality, depress and sink them, and
extinguish the natural warmth of the blood.</p>

<p>You will see from these evidences, which could be largely
multiplied, that long ago science spoke strongly by her best
speakers on matters of fact relating to the use of strong drinks.
You will note, moreover, that her utterances in that respect are
very urgent against strong drinks. At the same time you will
with fairness reply, “All that is true; but the argument is so
far against excessive use.” We all admit that argument; doctors
admit that universally; statesmen admit it; statisticians
prove that; clergymen who are not abstainers express that;
nay, the very sellers of strong drinks, the gentlemen who sell
wholesale, and the publicans who dispense for the gentlemen,
they, too, admit the solemn, unanswerable truth, that strong
drink kills. We therefore need no sphinx to inform us of
what is universally admitted. This, however, we do want to
know. We desire to be informed what is to be said by science
on the moderate use of these agents. Let abuse of them go to
the wall; let use stand forth alone, and let us hear what place
this strong drink holds in relation to man and animals—what
place it holds in nature—what good it is for man—what bad,
when it is used in moderation. Let us have the for and against.</p>

<p>The request is justice itself. There can be no objection
whatever to put the answer of science to the “for” as well as
the “against.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us begin by looking at the interpretations of science in
her latest teachings as to the nature of strong drinks. On
this point all are now agreed who speak scientifically. For
many ages wine was looked upon as a distinct drink, as a
something apart altogether from water. Strong wine will take
fire; water will quench fire. Wine has a color and sparkles
in the glass; water is colorless and clear as crystal. Wine
has taste and flavor and odor; water is tasteless and odorless.
Wine is the blood of the grape, and in some respects seems
akin to the blood of man; water is of all things least like
blood. Wine when drunken makes the face flush, the eyes
sparkle, the heart leap, the pulses sharp, the veins full; water
when drunken does none of these acts, and seems to do nothing
but respond to the natural wish for drink. Wine makes
the lips and tongue parched and dry, the drinker athirst;
water keeps the lips and tongue and stomach moist, and
quenches the thirst of the drinker. Wine when it is taken, sets
all the passions aglow and dulls the reason; bids men enjoy
and reason not; water creates no stir of passion, and leaves
the reason free. Wine makes for itself a first and second and
third and fourth claim on the drinker, so that the more of it he
takes the more of it he desires; it is overwhelming in the
warmth of its friendship; water sates the drinker after one
draught; makes no further claim on him than is just consistent
with its duty; leads him never to take more and more; and has
no seeming warmth in its friendship. Wine multiplies itself
into many forms, which appear to be distinct; it is new, it is
old; it is sweet, it is sour; it is sharp, it is soft; it is sparkling,
it is still; water is ever the same. Wine must be petted and
cherished, stored up in special skins and special caves, styled by
particular names, praised under special titles, and heartily liked
or disliked, like a child of passion; water, pshaw! it is everywhere;
it has one name, no more; it has one quality; it hurries
away out of the earth by brooks and rivulets and rivers
into the all-absorbing sea, where it is undrinkable; or it pours
down from the clouds as if the gods were tired of it; it is no
child of passion! Let the cattle, and the dogs, and the wild
beasts alone drink water. Let the man have the overpowering
drink, the blood of the grape—wine!</p>

<p>Alas! for this poetic dream. Science, poetic, too, in her way,
but passionless, destroys in those crucibles of hers, which men
call laboratories, this flimsy dream. There she tells that, when
one or two disguises are removed, even blood is water; as to
wine, that is mere dirty water—sixteen bottles or cups or any
other equal measures of water, pure and simple, from the clouds
and earth, to one poor bottle or cup of a burning, fiery fluid
which has been called ardent spirit, or spirit of wine, or alcohol,
with some little coloring matter, in certain cases a little acid, in
other cases a little sugar, and in still other cases a little cinder
stuff.</p>

<p>It is a pitiful fall, but it is such, and science not only declares
it, but proves it so to be. A pitiful let-down, that men
throughout all ages who have called themselves wine-drinkers
have been water-drinkers after all; that men who have called
themselves wine merchants have been water merchants; that
men who have bought, and still buy, wines at fabulous prices
have been buying, and still are buying, water. A dozen of
champagne, bought at a cost of five pounds ten shillings, very
choice—I am speaking by the book—consisted, when it was
all measured out, of three hundred ounces, or fifteen pints of
fluid, of which fluid thirteen pints and a half were pure water,
the rest ardent spirit, with a little carbonic acid, some coloring
matter like burnt sugar, a light flavoring ether in almost infinitesimal
proportion, or a trace of cinder stuff. Science, looking
on dispassionately, records merely the facts. If she thinks
that five pounds ten shillings was a heavy sum to pay for
thirteen pints and a half of water and one pint and a half of
spirit, she says nothing; she leaves that to the men and women
of sentiment and passionate feeling, buyers and sellers and
drinkers all round.</p>

<h2 id="EIGHT_CENTURIES_WITH_WALTER">EIGHT CENTURIES WITH WALTER
SCOTT.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By WALLACE BRUCE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Twenty-eight years have passed since the battle of Bosworth,
where the bitter struggle between the Houses of York and Lancaster
ceased with the defeat and death of Richard the Third.
We now come to the three best-known poems of Sir Walter,
viz.: “Marmion,” “The Lay of the Last Minstrel,” and the
“Lady of the Lake,” all grouped together in their relation to
history between the years 1513 and 1560.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope and purpose of our plan to consider
the beauties, defects or literary characteristics of these poems.
We are constrained to consider them merely as links in the
great historic chain. It may occur to the reader that they have
less to do with actual history than the novels which we have
considered; but, as the clear Scottish Lakes framed in rugged
mountains, reflect every outline of rock, forest and shrub, so
these poems framed and set in solid historic facts, reflect
clearly the minutest features of the social feudal life in the
reigns of James the Fourth and James the Fifth of Scotland.
It is in fact the peculiar province of poetry, in all ages, to preserve
the domestic habits and every-day happenings of the
people. It would not be rash to assert that the real life of
England and Scotland is better revealed in their ballads and
poems than in their chronicles and histories.</p>

<p>“Marmion” opens about the commencement of August, and
concludes with the battle of Flodden, the 9th of September, 1513.
It will be remembered that Henry the Eighth, at this time, was
on the English throne. He sailed to France in July with a
gallant army, where he formed the siege of Terouenne. During
his absence the Scottish King, James the Fourth, urged by
the French Queen, gathered an army to invade the north of
England. He was distinguished for his romantic chivalry, and
when the beautiful Princess of France called him her knight,
sent a ring from her own finger, and requested him “to ride
three miles on English ground for her sake,” the gallant king
thought that he could not in honor decline the request. His
fantastical spirit led to his ruin. He met the English forces at
Flodden under the Earl of Surrey, and the Scottish forces were
defeated. It was one of the bravest and fiercest struggles
recorded in Scottish or English history. The battle commenced
about four o’clock in the afternoon and when night came it was
still undecided. The Scottish center kept its ground, and the
King fought hand to hand with a bravery and courage worthy
of a better cause. The English lost five thousand, and the
Scotch ten thousand of their bravest soldiers. During the
night the Scottish army drew off in silent despair, when they
knew that their King and bravest nobles lay dead upon the
field. Or as Scott poetically expresses it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Their king, their lords, their mightiest low,</div>
<div class="verse i1">They melted from the field, as snow,</div>
<div class="verse i1">When streams are swollen and south winds blow,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Dissolves in silent dew.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Tweed’s echoes heard the ceaseless plash,</div>
<div class="verse i1">While many a broken band,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Disordered, through her currents dash,</div>
<div class="verse i1">To gain the Scottish land:</div>
<div class="verse i1">To town and tower, to down and dale,</div>
<div class="verse i1">To tell red Flodden’s dismal tale.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Tradition, legend, tune and song,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Shall many an age that wail prolong;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Still from the sire the son shall hear</div>
<div class="verse i1">Of the stern strife, and carnage drear,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Of Flodden’s fatal field,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Where shivered was fair Scotland’s spear,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And broken was her shield!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the description of this battle Scott is true to the minutest
points of history, and throughout the entire poem we breathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the atmosphere of the feudal ages. His sketch of James the
Fourth at Holyrood is a contribution to historical portraiture.
His words seem like side-lights thrown upon the king’s character,
until the chivalry and weakness of the man are presented
in living embodiment.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Old Holyrood rung merrily</div>
<div class="verse i1">That night with wassail, mirth and glee;</div>
<div class="verse i1">King James within her princely bower</div>
<div class="verse i1">Feasted the chiefs of Scotland’s power;</div>
<div class="verse i1">This feast outshone his banquets past;</div>
<div class="verse i1">It was his blithest—and his last.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The night of revelry in Edinburgh, preceding the direful
battle, may have suggested to Byron the grand poetic description
of the “beauty and chivalry” convened in Belgium’s capital
the night before the battle of Waterloo. The tradition to
which Scott alludes of the ghastly midnight proclamation at
the market cross of Edinburgh, summoning the king by name,
and many of his nobles and principal leaders, to appear before
the tribunal of Pluto within the space of forty days, found indeed
sad realization. The description of “Edinburgh after
Flodden,” a poem by Robert Aytoun, completes the picture,
and, in lyrical power, is not an unworthy postscript to the vigorous
canto which finds its culmination in the last words of
the English knight:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When Stanley was the cry—</div>
<div class="verse i1">A light on Marmion’s visage spread,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And fired his glazing eye;</div>
<div class="verse i1">With dying hand, above his head,</div>
<div class="verse i1">He shook the fragment of his blade,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And shouted ‘Victory!—</div>
<div class="verse i1">Charge Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!’</div>
<div class="verse i1">Were the last words of Marmion.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Lay of the Last Minstrel” is related in time to the
middle of the sixteenth century; and the scene is laid in the
border country of England and Scotland. It is sometimes
claimed that poetry is not so much the outgrowth of monastic
and studious seclusion as of stirring circumstances which inflame
the imagination. Whether this is true or not, the principle
finds proof in the border country of Scotland—a land of
turmoil, poetry and song. On the English side of the border
were strong and stately castles; on the Scottish side they were
constructed for the most part on a limited scale. A few fortresses,
like those of Jedburgh and Roxburgh, rivaled the
Southron defences; but, after the usurpation of Edward the
First, the Scots no longer attempted to defend their borders by
strong places; they relied upon their own courage, and acted
upon the familiar words of Douglas, that “they preferred to
hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.” In fact many of
the strongest fortresses were torn down, and utterly demolished,
that the enemy might not obtain a footing in the country. The
south of Scotland was reduced to a waste desert. Even as late
as the invasion of Cromwell the borders were left in this desolate
condition. The Hall of Cessford, or of Branksome, was
on the largest scale of the border fortresses in Scotland, but
could not be compared with the baronial castles of the northern
families of England.</p>

<p>The poem opens with a description of the customs of Branksome
Hall, how nine and twenty knights, with as many attendant
squires with belted sword and spur on heel,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Quitted not their harness bright,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Neither by day nor yet by night;</div>
<div class="verse i7">They lay down to rest,</div>
<div class="verse i7">With corselet laced,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Pillowed on buckler cold and hard;</div>
<div class="verse i7">They carved at the meal</div>
<div class="verse i7">With gloves of steel,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And they drank the red wine through the helmet barred.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That verse is worth a volume of history in emphasizing the
irregular life of the time and place where every man’s charter
was his sword. In the description of William of Deloraine and
the holy monk digging up the grave of the wizard, Michael,
Scott reveals the superstition of the times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Slow moved the Monk to the broad flag-stone,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Which the bloody cross was traced upon;</div>
<div class="verse i1">He pointed to a secret nook;</div>
<div class="verse i1">An iron bar the warrior took;</div>
<div class="verse i1">And the Monk made a sign with his withered hand,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The grave’s huge portal to expand.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The adventure with the strange knight on his return, the
gathering of the clans by the beacon light, the English forces
drawn up before the castle, and the decision of the battle by
the conflict of single champions, are all true to the spirit of the
times. Everything is so weird and wild that even the dwarf,
the book and magic charms do not seem entirely out of place
in the story. We must remember that it is a land of tradition—a
land aglow with the deeds of the Douglas and the Percy;
and those interested in the Border History will be well repaid
by reading carefully the notes accompanying the poem. It was
a labor of love to the author, for it relates intimately to the
valley of the Tweed. Here and there throughout the poem his
enthusiasm breaks out for “the land of brown heath and shaggy
wood—land of the mountain and the flood.” It would seem
like sacrilege not to quote the familiar lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Who never to himself hath said,</div>
<div class="verse i1">This is my own, my native land!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is no wonder that Scott struck the chords of the national
heart in this production, for it embodies so much of that unwritten
history which had an oracle at every fireside.</p>

<p>As “Marmion” furnished us with a picture of James the Fourth,
so the “Lady of the Lake” gives us a portrait of his son James
the Fifth. He is said to have been handsome in person, and
devoted to military exercises. He inherited his father’s love for
justice, “was well educated, and like his ancestor, James the
First, was a poet and musician.” His first care on taking the
government was to restore the border country, of which we
have just spoken, to something like order. He seized the
principal chieftains and imprisoned them. He executed Adam
Scott, known as king of the border, and John Armstrong, a
free-booting chief, to whom the whole border country paid
tribute. He thoroughly subdued these warlike chiefs, and it
passed into a proverb, that “he made the rush bush keep the
cow;” or, in other words, that cattle might remain safely in
the fields without a guard.</p>

<p>He proceeded in the same manner against the Highland
chiefs, and reduced the mountain country to a degree of quiet
unknown for generations. Some of his acts are pronounced
cruel by historians, but, in those bitter times, he was compelled
to consider the welfare of the whole nation, and was compelled
to be cruel in order to be kind.</p>

<p>James the Fifth also resembled his father in wandering, now
and then, about Scotland in the dress of a private person.
Many pleasing incidents are related of these royal visits in
disguise, and the king in this way readily discovered the actual
sentiments and feeling of the common people. Scott presents
him in the “Lady of the Lake” in this character, after a long
chase through the Highlands, which leaves him alone in the
deep wilds of the Trosachs. His adventure in the disguise of
Snowdoun’s knight, or James-Fitz-James, is doubly interesting
as it presents a trait of the monarch’s character. The world
likes true stories. It never outgrows the question of the child:
Did it really happen? This is one of the marked features of
these poems and romances. When we rise from the reading
of Scott’s works we have in our minds something more than a
mere story. We have not only the human qualities of love and
friendship, but also the characteristics and features of the times,
or the presentation of some well-known personage. The sketch
of James-Fitz-James, from the time when he meets Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Douglas near the margin of the Lake to the eventful day, when
Snowdoun’s knight is revealed to her at Stirling Castle as
Scotland’s King, is the faithful delineation of a real personage.
He is not lifted into a realm of mere fancy, but everything is
real and substantial about him. He is conducted to the island
home which shelters the outlawed Douglas; around the walls
hang trophies of the war and chase; spears, broadswords and
battle-axes garnish with rude tapestry the sylvan hall; he sleeps
upon the mountain heather, in the room</p>

<p>There is another character in the poem drawn true to life;
that of the bold mountain chieftain Roderick Dhu, an outlawed,
desperate man, representative of the Gaelic leaders
driven back into their mountain fastnesses. In the harsh treatment
which they received alike from kings and nobles, they
found ready excuse for depredation. Scott puts this idea with
great force in the lines of the Gaelic warrior:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Saxon, from yonder mountain high,</div>
<div class="verse i1">I marked thee send delighted eye</div>
<div class="verse i1">Far to the south and east, where lay,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Extended in succession gay,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Deep-waving fields and pastures green,</div>
<div class="verse i1">With gentle slopes and groves between;—</div>
<div class="verse i1">These fertile plains, that softened vale,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Were once the birthright of the Gael;</div>
<div class="verse i1">The stranger came with iron hand,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And from our fathers reft the land.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Where dwell we now? See, rudely swell</div>
<div class="verse i1">Crag over crag, and fell o’er fell.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Ask we this savage hill we tread</div>
<div class="verse i1">For fattened steer or household bread;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And well the mountains might reply,</div>
<div class="verse i1">‘To you, as to your sires of yore,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Belong the target and claymore!</div>
<div class="verse i1">I give you shelter in my breast,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Your own good blades must win the rest.’</div>
<div class="verse i1">Pent in this fortress of the north,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Think’st thou we will not sally forth,</div>
<div class="verse i1">To spoil the spoiler as we may,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And from the robber rend the prey?</div>
<div class="verse i1">Ay, by my soul! While on yon plain</div>
<div class="verse i1">The Saxon rears one shock of grain;</div>
<div class="verse i1">While, of ten thousand herds, there strays</div>
<div class="verse i1">But one along yon river’s maze,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The Gael, of plain and river heir,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Shall, with strong hand, redeem his share.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poem also reveals the old Highland custom of gathering
the clans by the cross of fire, and there is nothing more dramatic
in descriptive verse than the journey of that flaming
cross, as it passes from hand to hand, calling the mourner from
the house of death, and stopping midway the joyous marriage
procession:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fast as the fatal symbol flies,</div>
<div class="verse i1">In arms the huts and hamlets rise;</div>
<div class="verse i1">From winding glen, from upland brown,</div>
<div class="verse i1">They poured each hardy tenant down.</div>
<div class="verse i1">The fisherman forsook the strand,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The swarthy smith took dirk and brand;</div>
<div class="verse i1">With changed cheer, the mower blithe</div>
<div class="verse i1">Left in the half-cut swath the scythe;</div>
<div class="verse i1">The herds without a keeper strayed,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The plow was in mid-furrow stayed,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The falconer tossed his hawk away,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The hunter left his stag at bay;</div>
<div class="verse i1">So swept the tumult and affray</div>
<div class="verse i1">Along the margin of Achray.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The personal bravery of the Gael and Saxon is well presented
in the mountain march, and we venture a long quotation,
which finds apology not only in its strength and beauty,
but also in the fact that it reveals the character of the King and
the Highland chief. The Saxon says:</p>

<p>The entire poem is so true to fact and scenery that it forms
to-day a poetic guide-book to the country about Loch Katrine.
The description of sunset upon the lake, the deep recesses, the
lone mountain passes, the dashing cataracts, impart life, vigor
and reality; and every line reveals the spirit and bravery of
highland life.</p>

<p>We have been tempted to give an analysis of the plot of the
poem, and to quote some of the noble passages which Scott
speaks through the honest lips of Helen Douglas and her
faithful Malcolm; but it would have taken us aside from the
main purpose of our historic relation. The events of these
poems, as related to the world’s history, are trifling and insignificant,
when compared with the far-reaching policy of Louis
the Eleventh, which formed the frame work of our last paper;
and are in no way prophetic of the great events that follow in
the reign of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, depicted in “The
Monastery,” “The Abbott” and “Kenilworth;” but the rude life of
these warlike days has passed into the world’s poetry, and the
reader will trace, through the three poems which we have considered,
the devoted faith of manhood and the abiding love of
womanhood; ay more, perhaps discover a wholesome moral,
which ought not to be unheeded in these days of broadening
civilization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On the terms Annual and Biennial.</span>—There is certainly
much ambiguity between the terms annual and biennial.
Those plants which germinate in the spring and die in the
autumn are not very different from those which vegetate in the
summer or autumn and flower and die in the succeeding spring
or summer; nor indeed can I see much between them and
plants like <i>Agave</i>, which live in a barren state for many years,
and then flower once and die. It seems to be only a question of
time required to concentrate the requisite energy to produce
flowers and fruit. True annual plants may be divided into
winter annuals and summer annuals. The former usually
store up nutritive matter in the autumn to supply the flowering
state in the spring; differing in this from summer annuals.
But this is not constantly the case. The <i>Agave</i> is many years
doing this. Although this plant flowers only once, we of course
ought to have a term to distinguish it from the annuals. There
are also the plants which produce stoles rooting at the end,
such as the sympodes of <i>Fragaria</i>; in that case the plants are
truly perennial. But see such plants as <i>Epilobium</i>, where the
buds at the end of stoles alone remain alive during the winter,
and produce the plants of the succeeding year; what are we
to call these? We usually denominate them perennial. Then
how separate them from those which are not aërial, but go
through the same course? Then come such plants as <i>Orchis</i>,
where a new tuber is formed by the side of the old one each
year, usually at a very short distance from it, but sometimes at
some considerable distance, as in <i>Herminium</i>; and the tuber
which has flowered dies. The tuber is therefore a winter
annual. Of course all these ought not to be confounded with
the true perennials, where the same root lives and flowers at
least several years in succession. DeCandolle’s terms, <i>mono-</i>
and <i>poly-carpic</i> will not do; for they convey another idea.
<i>Mono-</i> and <i>poly-tocus</i>, as suggested by A. Gray, are better,
but here we do not distinguish between <i>Agave</i> and <i>Brassica</i>.
And he has not attempted to distinguish these from <i>Orchis</i> (except
by calling them perennial, as we all do), or <i>Orchis</i> from
<i>Fragaria</i>. Here is a subject of much interest for those to study
who pay attention to such matters.—<i>Journal of Botany.</i></p>

<p>There is a strange plant with a curious flower growing in the
damp valleys of New Granada, called <i>Masdevallia chimaera</i>.
It is one of the unique productions of the vegetable kingdom.
This plant has a dense cluster of thick leaves; the slender
flower stems creep along and flower under the moss or leaves.
The flower cup is divided into three lobes, and is whitish in
color, with irregular spots of pink. So fantastic is this flower
that a writer in <i>La Nature</i> says: “In looking at this strange
flower one sees the colors of a nocturnal bird, the form of a
large spider in the middle, with two small, piercing black
eyes.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Trees of Lake Chad.</span>—Dr. Nachtigal, in his “African Journeys,”
describes some curious trees that grow in the region of
Lake Chad. The butter-tree, called in that country <i>toso-kan</i>,
bears a green, round fruit, ripening into yellow, about as large as
a small citron. This fruit consists of a nut resembling a horse-chestnut
in color and in size, and a palatable, fleshy, smooth-skinned
covering like a plum. The nut affords an oil, which
solidifies under a slight decrease of temperature, and is used
throughout North Africa as a substitute for butter. The <i>Parpia
biglobosa</i>, of the same region, a leguminous plant, furnishes an
excellent food in its seeds, which are eatable while still unripe.
The ripe seeds contain a thick, saffron-colored marrow, inclosing
black, shining grains. The meal made from them forms,
when mixed with water or milk, a pap, which has a sweet and
pleasant taste at first, but soon cloys. Relieved with sour milk
or tamarind-juice, it forms a dish healthful and enjoyable to
all. The wool-tree is the third characteristic tree of the country.
It rises straight up, with thick, horizontal branches arranged in
whorls, one above the other, and derives its name from its fruit,
which bursts like pods of cotton, and discloses a similar mass
of fibers, lustrous and soft as eider-down. This “wool” is used
in stuffing cushions and mattresses and for the wadding-armor
of heavy cavalry. It has the valuable property of never
becoming so compact but that it can be restored to its original
volume by a short exposure to the sun. The tree is a favorite
place of refuge for the negroes in time of danger. Taking their
children and goods up with them they secure an excellent natural
fortress among the whorls of its limbs.—<i>Popular Science
Monthly.</i></p>

<p>Peach leaves curl and wither because of a fungus growth
upon their surfaces. This vegetable parasite often ruins the
first crop of leaves and unless they are replaced by a new
growth early in the summer the tree is injured, often permanently.</p>

<p>Concerning the life of Milton, the following information is
received from a distinguished Professor of English Literature
in one of the great universities of America: “The book you
ask for is ‘Milton,’ by Mark Patterson, B.D., Rector of Lincoln
College, Oxford. It is in the ‘English Men of Letters’ series,
edited by John Morley. It is pleasantly written, interesting,
animated, and to the point. A very large work is the ‘Life of
Milton in connection with the History of the Times,’ by David
Mason, M.A., LL.D., Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature
in the University of Edinburgh.”</p>

<p>In the organization and conduct of Local Circles, there are
developed many ingenious and useful schemes, devices, exercises,
etc. I shall always be glad to receive suggestions from
persons who devise and test such novelties of method.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A California friend writes: “There are doubtless many
reading the C. L. S. C. Course who have not the advantage of
Local Circles, and who, beside, have no friends who are interested
in the work with whom they might correspond. Why
would it not be a good plan to form a C. L. S. C. Correspondence
Circle for such as wish to improve themselves in that
way?” Persons desiring such correspondence may send their
names, with postoffice addresses, to Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield,
N. J.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. in Plymouth, Massachusetts, have
sent a fragment of Plymouth rock, which is to be attached with
great care to the banner-staff of the C. L. S. C. Our correspondent
says: “Perhaps it would be of interest to members
of the C. L. S. C. in general to know that the rock is said by
geologists to have been brought here from the far north during
the glacial period, and is the only one of its kind on the coast.”
Our correspondent adds: “Our Circle received with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
pleasure your proposal for the C. L. S. C. picnic at Plymouth
in 1884, and are ready to enter into any plan which you may
suggest.” We hope to have that picnic in June.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A New England woman writes: “I know mothers with from
four to six little children, who take the Chautauqua course, and
find that economized time is a gain in all things, while their
homes are as scrupulously tidy, and their social relations as
well sustained, as if they had not undertaken it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An old lady 68 years of age dreads “the <i>examination</i> of
the C. L. S. C.” Does she not know, or will not some one tell
her that, while we desire thoroughness of work, and while we
do provide a university course with rigid examinations for
those who are qualified to attempt it, the C. L. S. C. does not
require any “examination” whatever? It requires the reading
of certain books, and the statement to the central office that
they have been read. It also desires the filling out of certain
memoranda which are not in any sense examination papers.
Let us encourage the fearful, that they may join the Circle,
prosecute the readings, catch the inspiration, receive the diploma,
and continue through the coming years to read the
appointed books!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A distinguished educator and personal friend of other years,
resident in Kingston, Jamaica, writes: “I think I have hit on
the way to introduce reading matter into the homes of our
peasantry. In some districts where a minister or intelligent
schoolmaster will take hold of the affair, I get a number of
people, (from ten to twenty) to subscribe one shilling (twenty-five
cents) each. With this money I send for a number of illustrated
monthly papers, costing with postage, two shillings each
<i>per annum</i>. These are circulated among the subscribers, each
keeping the paper a week. In the course of the year I get the
reading of what would otherwise have cost ten shillings to
secure. Many that could not be induced to pay two shillings for
the exclusive use of one would venture upon one shilling for
the privilege of reading many papers.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>D. Lothrop &amp; Co. consent to make an edition of “The Hall
in the Grove” at seventy-five cents, binding it in strong manilla
cover, for the use of the C. L. S. C., which decision enables
us to retain “The Hall in the Grove” on our list.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A good housewife writes: “My fall work out door is about
done. My corn is all gathered, and the two pigs are ready for
killing. As soon as it is colder I shall be ready to go to work
in earnest. You would laugh to see me at work in the garden,
about my potatoes and onions, and then coming in, getting
dinner and making my toilet, taking my embroidery and sitting
down to earn a few cents beside what I can raise. Agriculture,
science and art, are in reality connected. Then there
is a basket of Christmas gifts yet to make for the Sunday-school
children, by myself, and I have just done re-papering a
small room that I may read, write, and work with comfort.
I buried my aged husband September 23. He was nearly 84
years old. We were nearly forty years married.”</p>

<p>All new Circles should report at once to the C. L. S. C. office,

<p><b>Ontario</b> (Picton).—The Picton branch of the C. L. S. C. held
its second meeting for 1883-84 on the evening of November 19.
We start on the new year with an increased membership of
twelve, and also with a greater degree of enthusiasm in the
prosecution of our studies. Our membership now reaches
thirty-nine, representing the classes of ’84, ’85, ’86, ’87. The
program for the evening’s entertainment consisted of selections
bearing on the life and character of Martin Luther; two papers,
one on art, condensed from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, the other on
the lives of Philip and Alexander; an interesting and animated
conversation on the works of Oliver Wendell Holmes, and quotations
from the same, which were given by most of the members;
the quotations in the November number of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
on Grecian history, singing of selections from Chautauqua
songs, and a solo by one of our members, which closed a
very interesting and instructive entertainment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Maine</b> (Calais).—When the news of the C. L. S. C. movement,
and the advantages it offered for home study reached
Calais, it was hailed with delight by three teachers, who enrolled
themselves as members of the class of ’83. These kept
up the work till last year, when they were joined by seven
members of the class of ’86. During the winter and spring we
held informal meetings monthly at the houses of the members.
We received so much benefit from these that, in September,
we met and organized a Local Circle. Our officers consist of
a president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer, with an
executive committee of three, whose duty it is to prepare programs
for the meetings. We hold our meetings fortnightly in
the parlor of the Congregational Church, which a good friend
rented for us. We now number about thirty members, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>

<p><b>Vermont</b> (West Brattleboro).—The Pansy branch of the C. L.
S. C. was organized on the evening of September 13, with officers
consisting of president, secretary and executive committee,
chosen for three months. By commencing thus early we were
enabled to have the books on hand, and be in complete working
order by October 1. We began with twelve names, and
have since increased the list, until we now have enrolled sixteen
regular and eleven local members, all of class ’87, and
who have entered upon the Course with an earnest purpose to
do their best to cultivate “the gift” that is in them. We have
as yet settled upon no definite plan for our weekly meetings,
but have been experimenting to find what exercises were best
fitted to our needs and capacities. We have had at different
times reading from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, essays, one minute
oral reports on subjects previously assigned, quotation exercises,
question boxes, etc. Bryant’s memorial day was also
appropriately observed. We always close with the song so
familiar and dear to all who have heard it in the Hall of
Philosophy, “Day is Dying in the West,” followed by prayer.
November 21 was a “red letter day” in our annals, because it
was then our privilege to listen to a lecture by Dr. Vincent.
The members of both our local circles, numbering about
seventy-five persons, sat in a body in the hall, and the “salute”
was given heartily. After the lecture the Doctor was so kind
as to improvise an informal reception, and give us a short address
concerning our C. L. S. C. work, together with the pleasure
of a personal meeting with him, and we parted feeling
grateful for the renewed courage and ardor with which we shall
continue the year’s reading, and for the increased opportunities
for culture that have been made possible to us by the
founder of the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p><b>Massachusetts</b> (Lowell).—On the evening of September 26,
1883, about twenty persons met in the vestry of the Eliot
Church and formed a local circle. Some have left, while
others have joined. We have now thirteen local members and
ten regular members. We adopted the “Proposed plan for a
Local Circle,” given in the Chautauqua Text-book No. 2, with
slight changes. Our meetings are held on Monday evenings,
every two weeks. They are very interesting and profitable.
There are four other local circles in Lowell, and we intend to
hold union meetings on the memorial days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Massachusetts</b> (West Haverhill).—About twenty from this
vicinity were privileged to attend the Assembly at Framingham,
Mass. Of course we came home all aglow with enthusiasm
for the C. L. S. C. Early in October we held a public
meeting, thus adding some new names to our list. We now
have a membership of twenty-five. Our meetings are well
attended and interesting. We start out on this year of work
with fresh courage and hope, and with strong faith in the C. L.
S. C. as a means of blessing to all who engage in its work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Massachusetts</b> (New Bedford).—The pastor of the Allen Street
M. E. Church of this city suggested the formation of a local
circle to a few young people of his parish last fall. He proposed
that a meeting should be held in the vestry of the church
every two weeks for a review of study and for mutual benefit.
He called an organization meeting on the first of October, and
when the evening was over there were thirty-three names enrolled.
He presented a constitution which was adopted. A
president, secretary, treasurer and committee of instruction
were elected. This committee of instruction consists of the
officers and three ladies. One of these persons, with any two
members of the circle whom he or she may select, arranges the
program for each meeting. We have had four regular meetings,
each of which has been attended by from forty to sixty
persons—members of the Circle and their friends. Each evening
we have had original papers on topics suggested by the
study, tests, suitable poems, songs, etc. We have now forty-two
members, ranging in years from fourteen to fifty. It was a
little undecided at first what we should call ourselves, but it
seemed like such an earnest band of workers, some one suggested
we should be the “Philomaths.” We all praise the
Chautauqua movement for the precious advantages it offers to
all “lovers of learning.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Connecticut</b> (Westville).—Our circle was formed in January,
1883. Although we had lost three months’ study, the year’s
work was finished before July. We review all our reading in
our meetings, held once in two weeks, the members taking
turns in conducting the reviews, and dividing an evening’s work
between three or four. We started with seven, all regular
members, and now number fourteen, ten of whom are regular
members. We enjoy our Chautauqua meetings very much,
and as none of us like to miss them, we have a good attendance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>New York</b> (Brooklyn).—We have lately organized a circle in
the midst of this great city, which is the outcome of many informal
meetings of resident members of the class of 1887. The
proposition to form ourselves into an organized branch of the
grand Chautauqua Circle was received with uproarious applause,
and the manner in which every member lent his aid in
arranging the details, bespoke the individual enthusiasm in
the work. The program for our next meeting is as follows:
Opening exercises; essay, “The Persian Wars;” remarks by
the president on collateral themes; essay, “The Establishment
of the Athenian Democracy;” speech by the treasurer
upon subjects of his own choice; questions and answers;
essay, “The Age of Pericles;” concluding exercises, which
are very entertaining.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>New York</b> (Mount Kisco).—The Mount Kisco C. L. S. C. was
organized in October, 1882. We meet in the rooms of the
Lyceum, bi-monthly. The circle is made up of ten members,
all enthusiastic, ardent workers in the field of science and literature.
We recite, in concert, the answers to the questions in
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, the leader reading the questions. The
readings for the last two weeks are then discussed. We try
to make our meetings quite informal, believing that restraint
will thus be avoided. Our officers consist of a president, vice-president
and secretary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>New York</b> (Greenwich).—Our class of ’86 have semi-monthly
meetings. During October and November we used the questions
in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. One of our members gave the
geography of Greek History from a large map, and others
read from American Authors, Demosthenes’ Orations, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>New York</b> (Newark Valley).—On October 17 we organized a
local circle of the C. L. S. C., and though our regular members
number but twelve, yet we have some very interesting
and instructive meetings; upon the whole a very enthusiastic
club. Our plan is briefly this: We meet once in two weeks,
and after a Chautauqua song, and prayer, have two or three
essays and recitations; then general class exercises in Greek
History, or the current subject, a question box, and free criticisms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Pennsylvania</b> (Canonsburg).—Although Canonsburg had what
we would call a flourishing circle last year, we gave it no
christening. We had a membership of twenty-five. We purchased
the Geological Charts, which were a great help to the
imagination in filling up the incredible proportions of those
monsters of past ages. While we were studying astronomy
we had the pleasure and profit of hearing a lecture on “The
planet Jupiter,” by Professor McAdam, of Washington College.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
After the lecture the Professor kindly joined the class in the
yard, and spent an hour in tracing the constellations. The examination
papers were promptly answered. The year closed with
an ice cream supper, when we spent the evening socially, and
sang many of the Chautauqua songs. September 19 we organized
for another year’s work with fifteen members. One of our
members on going to Alabama organized a circle there. Others
who have left us are still reading. We open our meetings
with Scripture readings and roll call, at which each member
responds by a motto. We use the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
and recite the Required Reading by topic. We play
the Chautauqua Games, and we would say to all circles, “Get
games.” At the close of each meeting a few minutes are
allowed for criticisms, in which all take part.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Pennsylvania</b> (Ridley Park).—At the call of a few of our literary
loving people last spring, a preliminary meeting relative
to the establishment of a local circle was held at the Ridley
Park Seminary, and at least forty people assembled to hear the
explanation of the principles embodied in the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Circle, as given by Mr. Wm. Curtis Taylor,
a gentleman to whom our people are much indebted for their
present literary inspiration. At a second meeting held a week
or two following, a permanent organization was effected and
officers elected. This circle, while it centers at Ridley Park, is
not exclusively confined to this place, but extends a halo as it
were around a circuit of probably ten miles. We are even
represented in Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware. Holding
our meetings but once a month, and having our membership
so thoroughly scattered, we have found it a good plan to
establish what we term sub-circles, which hold their meetings
about once a week. These are presided over by chairmen
appointed by our president, and comprise at this time three
sub-circles—Ridley Park, Sharon Hill, and Philadelphia. At
our last meeting, November 6, to each of these was assigned
some question for consideration, upon which one of their members
is expected to write an essay, and the sub-circle itself
be prepared to answer any questions propounded by the other
sub-circles on its particular subject. For example, the Ridley
Park sub-circle which has been assigned the subjects of
History and Art, will be prepared to answer whatever questions
may be asked by the members of the other circles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>New Jersey</b> (Newark).—At a meeting held October 8, a
local circle was organized, called the “Central,” composed of
about thirty members. The meetings are held fortnightly, the
exercises being varied from time to time. In part they consist
of essays and reading of short extracts from the best authors,
varied by discussions as to the best methods of pursuing the
appointed studies. An executive committee of five, appointed
by the president, holding the office for one year, determine the
nature of the exercises and make the necessary appointments.
There are at least four local circles in the city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>District of Columbia</b> (Washington).—At the earliest moment
“Union” C. L. S. C. reorganized for their third year of study.
Nearly every member was present, and there were a number of
new recruits. One of the circle gave a graphic description of a
visit to Chautauqua, of its surroundings and methods of work,
thus creating an enthusiasm and a determination among the
members to do thorough work and win their diplomas by honest
endeavor. When they come to Chautauqua, as they will in
1885, they wish to feel that they can justly and proudly march
through the Arches—true Chautauquans. The circle meets
every Thursday evening at the residence of one of the members,
and the exercises are opened by singing the Chautauqua
songs as found in the <i>Assembly Herald</i>, with organ accompaniment,
after which the subject of the lesson is discussed in
a conversational way, by questions and answers and by essays
by the members. As all are working members and realize that
application is profitable, our meetings seldom lack in interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Maryland</b> (Baltimore).—The “Eutaw” branch of the C. L. S. C.
held its November meeting in the cheerful parlors of the church
parsonage, Rev. H. R. Naylor, D.D., and family as hosts. The exercises
opened with singing and prayer. The president of the
branch, after a few explanatory remarks, stated that the occasion
was especially significant and interesting in that Miss
Bessie G. Thomson, a member of our circle, had completed
the required course of Reading, and had received her diploma
to that effect, and would deliver before the Circle a valedictory
address. After the address our president favored the circle
with a conversazione upon the value of an education, abounding
in apt quotations and valuable suggestions. This was followed
by Bryant memorial readings. The very pleasant entertainment
closed by a display of pictures of travel by one of
our number who has recently returned from Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Ohio</b> (Athens).—Our local circle held its first meeting this
year, on October 1, with twenty members present. The leaven
is working gradually, and each year we are able to record a
number of new members, as well as an increased enthusiasm
among the older ones. “The Irrepressibles” are well represented,
but this term might, with propriety, be applied to all
our members, as they have fairly won it by indefatigable zeal
and industry. We have lost two of our members during the
last year; one has removed to another part of the state, the
other has gone to join the school above. Mrs. Alice S. Sloane
was a member of the class of ’84, and, although an invalid at
the time of taking the course, never ceased to keep up her
reading until within a few months of her death. Her interest
in the work was remarkable in one so afflicted, and whenever
opportunity offered itself, she urged upon others the importance
of accepting the advantages offered in this course.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Ohio</b> (St. Mary’s).—Our C. L. S. C. was organized the first
week in October, 1882. We commenced with seven members,
but one of whom had been at Chautauqua during the summer.
One was a graduate of the class that year. At the close of the
year we numbered fourteen. Attendance good. In alphabetical
order each one takes charge of the exercises for the afternoon,
asks the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and calls upon each
member for a view of the topic assigned them in the Required
Reading, these topics having been given out at the previous
meeting. We keep the Memorial Days, and must say our
members are quite enthusiastic in the work. We have had no
lectures, etc., as yet, but hope to some time in the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Indiana</b> (Brazil).—We have organized a C. L. S. C. at this
place with about twenty members, and the prospect is that
several more will unite with us. There is an unusual degree of
interest manifested. We call our circle the “Philomathean.”
This is the first circle ever organized here, though a few of the
members have been reading for two and three years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Illinois</b> (Carlinville).—We have an enthusiastic local C. L. S.
Circle at this place of fifteen members, five of whom belong
to the general Circle, and to the class of ’84. We elect president,
vice-president and secretary every two months; critic and
question committees serve for one month. The latter furnish
questions requiring verbal answers, or papers, as case may be.
At roll call each responds with items of news quotations, or
something of interest, short. Bryant’s Day roll call was responded
to by a quotation from his writings by each. On
Luther’s memorial day each one had something to say of him.
We derive much profit and pleasure from every part of the
course, and think it most admirably arranged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Illinois</b> (Rushville).—The “Vincent” branch of the C. L. S. C.
meets semi-monthly, and we are happy to say that our interest
is unabated. This is our second year, and although we have
lost several members by removal, and two have taken up a
collegiate course, we still have an enthusiastic membership of
fifteen. We have a president, vice-president, secretary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
treasurer. Our order of exercises varies. At our last meeting
we had read Dr. Talmage’s lecture on “Happy Homes,” delivered
at Chautauqua. Some of our members took the <i>Daily
Herald</i> during the Assembly, and we have laid in store many
good lectures which will be read at the circle during the winter.
We advise all members to take the <i>Herald</i> another year
if they want to enjoy what is next best to going to Chautauqua—that
is, hearing all about it. The items from other local
circles are read with great interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Illinois</b> (Yorkville).—The local circle of our town was reorganized
this year with thirty members. The officers consist
of a president and secretary, both of whom hold office for a
period of one month. The president appoints a teacher for
each branch of study, and critics on language and pronunciation
are appointed for each meeting. Every one feels a deep
interest in the work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Michigan</b> (Decatur).—For two winters some ladies of our town
have had a class for the study of history, the members thinking
they could not take the time necessary for the Chautauqua
course. The meetings were pleasant and instructive, but
during the past summer one and another of the class, and some
not belonging to it, determined to take the C. L. S. C. readings.
Accordingly a “Pansy” circle was organized October 1. Various
reasons prevented our meeting again for nearly three weeks,
but since that time we have had regular weekly meetings.
They are not weakly, however, for with most of the circle the
readings have been studies. Our president, who by the way is
a member of the class of ’84, and has studied alone for three
years, tells us that we do more studying than any circle she
has known. We have ten members and two “local members,”
and hope for additions to our number. We think the “Chautauqua
Idea” a grand one. May it run the wide world through.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Wisconsin</b> (Milwaukee).—The “Delta” circle, of this city, reorganized
October 2. Last year we numbered but sixteen, and
this year we have enrolled over thirty, of whom twenty-five are
regular members of the C. L. S. C. Our officers consist of a
president, vice-president and secretary, elected annually; also
a referee, elected monthly, who is expected to be able to settle
doubtful questions in regard to pronunciation, etc. Meetings
are held once a week at the homes of the members. We
follow the outline of studies published in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
Our exercises consist generally of a review of the week’s reading,
conducted by a leader who is appointed two weeks in advance,
and who assigns topics, allowing one week for preparation.
We try to make our meetings as informal and conversational
as possible. It is at the pleasure of the leader to vary
the exercises as much as he chooses. Our last evening was
devoted to political economy, the leader having arranged for a
discussion on “Free Trade versus Protection,” in which six
members participated. The interest in the circle is constantly
increasing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Wisconsin</b> (Elkhorn).—At the close of last June the local
circle at Elkhorn seemed at its lowest ebb. Owing to removals,
sickness, and other reasons, only two remained out of
the six who started in January, 1882, who were able to attend
the regular meetings, and when one of them removed in September
to Milwaukee, the remaining member almost forgot our
class motto, “Never be discouraged,” for among her acquaintances
there was apparently but little interest in the C. L. S. C.,
and she seemed doomed to plod on alone. In October, without
any <i>great</i> effort on the part of any one, there sprang into
being a full-fledged local circle of nine members. This circle
had been in existence under the name of the “Elkhorn Mutual
Improvement Society,” for two years, and some good work had
been done in English History and Literature, but now an inspiration
seized the members to take up the C. L. S. C. studies,
and the society was reorganized without a change of name,
and retaining the old constitution nearly intact, into a C. L. S.
C. local circle. Some of the members entered upon the
studies with misgivings, lest they should not be able to do the
work, but so far the work has been easier than was anticipated,
and the circle, as a whole, is doing it enthusiastically and
thoroughly. The main cause of this renewal of interest in the
C. L. S. C. may be fairly traced, I think, to the influence of the
Monona Lake Sunday-school Assembly, whose sessions at
Madison last August were attended by two members of the
“Mutual Improvement Society.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Wisconsin</b> (Milwaukee).—The C. L. S. C. is booming here.
The “Bay View” local circle recently organized by Rev. B. F.
Sanford has thirty members, and has live meetings. This one
and one on the south side are part of the result of Dr. Vincent’s
late visit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Iowa</b> (Muscatine).—The local paper of Muscatine says: There
is probably no town of its size where so much genuine literary
taste abounds in society, as in Muscatine. Last evening, the
third Chautauqua circle was organized with a membership of
twenty-five, and the other two are flourishing like green bay
trees. It will be said by the cynic that these organizations lack
true <i>cultus</i> and real literary taste, the cultivated man and
woman having little occasion to put themselves under an arbitrary
discipline to compel the prosecution of their reading or
study, and feeling little sympathy for a movement that violates
the sacred privacy between author and reader, and refusing to
submit their literary tastes to the procrustean exercise of any
man’s dictation. We have heard these things said against the
Chautauqua system, but if a tree is to be known by its fruits,
there can be but one opinion of an organization that is rearing
so many youth of our land of both sexes in the cultivation of
their mental powers and graces, informing them in history,
philosophy and art, bringing them betimes to the streams of
pure literature, and accomplishing them so thoroughly in their
wide range of study as to make them authorities everywhere by
reason of the universality and accuracy of their attainments.
It is thus that we find the advanced Chautauquans whom we
have the honor to meet, and so are they impressing themselves
upon the whole country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Dakota</b> (Yankton).—Our circle of ten or twelve members has
had an existence of something more than a year. Our meetings,
held once in two weeks, are intensely interesting and instructive,
and each member seems enthusiastic in appreciation of
the work. The interest has been such that one of our most
difficult problems has been how to condense the discussion of
the various points of interest in our studies, in order to close at
a reasonable hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Dakota</b> (Faulkton).—The former president of the C. L. S. C.
work in Muscatine (Iowa) has removed to Dakota. The following
notice from the Faulkton (Dakota) <i>Herald</i> proves that
Chautauqua has not been forgotten: Last Friday evening a
goodly number assembled at the residence of Major J. A. Pickler
to discuss the advisability of forming a Chautauqua circle
in Faulkton, and all appeared to be highly interested in having
a society here. After some few remarks the Chautauqua circle
was organized with Mrs. J. A. Pickler, president.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Kansas</b> (Leavenworth).—This is our second year. We organized
in March, and although five months behind, we succeeded
in completing the first year’s work; but were thereby compelled
to double the lessons and omit the observance of the
Memorial Days, and the following of the admirable plan laid
down in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>; but are now marching ahead
with the class of ’86, and find the enthusiasm somewhat
increased. Our meetings are conducted on the conversational
plan, being led by one of the best instructors, a former Professor
in our public schools. We find it more interesting to assign
portions of the lesson to each member for discussion. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
appoint a critic at each meeting, and at the close of the lesson
he brings his criticisms before the circle. On Memorial Days we
briefly discuss the life of our character, and give our individual
opinions in regard to his characteristics, and each member gives
a selection or quotation from one of his works. This is the
fourth year for one of our members, who, before the organization
of the circle, pursued the course alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Nebraska</b> (Omaha).—Early in September a temporary organization
of the C. L. S. C. was effected in our city, and the
objects and requirements of the course were explained by an
old Chautauquan. Shortly after, Dr. Vincent visited us, and
by special request addressed the would-be Chautauquans,
arousing the intelligent enthusiasm of a large number of listeners.
A meeting was called at an early date, at which time
the circle was permanently organized, officers elected, constitution
and by-laws adopted, books ordered, and the “Omaha”
C. L. S. C. was ready for work. By the help of several old Chautauquans
the ’87s are greatly encouraged. The entire membership
are highly pleased with the course of study, and are
determined to complete the course. The program committee
is appointed monthly, thereby affording great variety in the
order of exercises. Thus far in our work we have profitably
used individual recitations, concert drills, essays, conversations,
round-tables, readings, addresses, spelling matches, etc.
So great has been the interest shown, that notwithstanding
regular meetings are held semi-monthly, extra meetings have
been demanded. The committee aims to secure thorough and
systematic reviews at each meeting of all subjects studied, and
are meeting with admirable success in this attempt. The Chautauqua
University is gaining power and popularity in the “Gate
City,” and other circles are being organized in our midst.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>California</b> (Vallejo).—The circle of the Chautauqua University
formed in this town is progressing finely. Meetings are
held regularly, and the studies of the previous week are profitably
and thoroughly discussed. From the nature of the work,
and the interest manifested in the same, there is every assurance
that our circle, which now numbers seven, will increase.
Did the people but know the advantages, the real, genuine
benefits to be derived through the C. L. S. C., I have no hesitancy
in saying that we would not only have the above number
of members, but that number of circles in the town.</p>

<h2 id="THE_C_L_S_C_IN_THE_SOUTH">THE C. L. S. C. IN THE SOUTH.</h2>


<p>The local circle reports from the south are so encouraging
that we can not refrain from devoting an extra corner to them
alone. Most zealously must the friends of the movement have
worked to have produced such abundant results. Circles have
been reported this year from:—</p>

<p>Hardinsburgh, Kentucky; president, Miss Anna L. Gardiner;
secretary, Miss Anna R. Bassett.</p>

<p>Jackson, Tennessee; president, Rev. F. P. Flanniker; vice-president,
B. S. McClaren; secretary, T. J. Porter.</p>

<p>Murfreesboro, Tennessee; secretary, H. H. Clayton, Jr.</p>

<p>Richmond, Virginia; chairman, Wm. M. Coulling.</p>

<p>Memphis, Tennessee; secretary, E. M. Schwalmeyer.</p>

<p>Oxford, Mississippi; secretary, Miss Mattie E. Dennis.</p>

<p>Also from the following places, though officers are not given:
Fort Worth and Bonham, Texas; Petersburgh, Virginia;
Slaughterville, Kentucky; Spartansburg, South Carolina.</p>

<p>Two circles from Washington, D. C.; secretary of one is
Frank P. Reeside, 1219 D. Street, S. W.; of the other, Miss
Nettie Love. Making <i>seven</i> circles now reported as at work in
Washington, D. C.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Independence, Missouri, there is a circle of forty-seven
members.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From Nashville a lady writes: “The ‘Nashville’ local circle
of the C. L. S. C. was organized at the rooms of the Y. M.
C. A. the latter part of September, with a membership of about
twenty. We have had three very interesting meetings, consisting
of essays, lectures, questions on the lessons, etc. We
meet every two weeks at the Y. M. C. A. rooms. We intend to
give all the time we can to the work. All the members are
deeply interested.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The secretary of a new circle in Salem, North Carolina, says:
“We organized a circle in Salem on November 3, consisting of
twenty-eight members, which has since increased to thirty-two.
A president, vice-president and secretary were appointed.
These officers, with a committee of two on instruction, are to
arrange programs for entertainment at the monthly meetings
of the circle. For the first meeting of the circle the program
consists of reviews, in the form of questions given to each
member, readings and recitations, also music. We began the
readings in October, and have divided ourselves into a number
of small circles for the more careful study of the weekly
readings. So far we greatly enjoy the readings, and hope to
derive profit from them, both in the increase of knowledge and
improvement of literary taste.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A gentleman who writes to Dr. Vincent from Richmond,
Virginia, says in regard to the C. L. S. C.: “I believe there is
a great field here, and that one with time to devote to it could
do a great deal of good. I have every reason to believe that
the leading paper here would do all in its power to help forward
such a work, and I think that some of the Professors at
the Richmond College would be willing to deliver a course of
lectures. My idea is that by having numbers of little circles—or
rather segments—formed in different parts of the city, a
large, general circle could be formed, such general circle to
meet once in two weeks for the purpose of hearing lectures,
etc. The smaller societies could of course meet every week in
their own localities, for discussion of the course being read. I
think there is a desire for something of this kind in the minds
of a great many people here, and I have very ambitious ideas
as to the future of such a society. I would like quite a large
number of C. L. S. C. circulars for distribution here as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>A circle of ’87s was organized in September at Jackson, Tennessee.
Thirty-five members, two ministers, two lawyers, two
editors, eleven teachers, merchants, etc. The circle has about
as many ladies as gentlemen, and holds a meeting every Monday
evening from 7:30 to 10 o’clock, at a private residence.
The studies for the week are taken up in order. Essays, discussions,
lectures, query box, music, declamations, etc., constitute
the program. Each exercise is limited to fifteen minutes,
and every member prepares his exercise as he desires.
Some have drawn maps of Greece at its different historical
stages. One evening each month is devoted especially to some
study which has been completed. American Literature was
first Monday in December. Mark Twain, Hawthorne, Longfellow,
Holmes and Whittier were treated by lectures and discussions.</p>

<h3>REPORTS AND QUESTIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: There are persons in this world who unite in
purely literary and intellectual enterprises. The union creates
a sort of literary friendship. There are people who unite in
sympathy, loving a common object, sharing in sorrow, sharing
in joy, creating a friendship full of sentiment. There are people
in this world who are united in practical efforts. They
have a common aim. They agree upon a method; they coöperate
for the result, and this is practical friendship.</p>

<p>The charm of the C. L. S. C. is found in this, that it is a union
in intellectual and literary activity, a union in affection, a union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
in practical aim and service. It aims to do three things:—To
cultivate the intellect, to cultivate the heart, and to develop the
executive forces of our natures. By this three-fold bond we
are united as members of the C. L. S. C. We meet this glad
day in this beautiful grove, under the play of this charming
sunshine; we meet to remember, we meet to rejoice, we meet
to resolve. And as the years go by may our memories grow
sweeter, our rejoicing more intense, and our resolves stronger.
And as we meet from year to year “to study the words and the
works of God,” let us try “to keep our Heavenly Father in the
midst.” The blending of the mottoes, felicitous only as a
blending of mottoes, does not express the whole theological
truth I would convey.</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson said, in writing one of his charming letters to
his brother, “I have through all these years been seeking God,
and I am just awakening to the fact that all these years it is
God who has been seeking me.” We need not try to keep our
Heavenly Father in the midst. In the boundlessness of his
grace, he is glad to come into the midst and here to abide, and
if we have any longing of heart after him, however feeble it
may be, it is because he is already there, breathing into us his
own life, and giving to us a measure of his own joy. Let us
pray to him.</p>

<p>We thank thee, our Father, that through the year thou hast
been with us, and that thou hast guided us; that in hours of
prosperity thou hast held us, and in hours of sorrow thou hast
given us comfort. And on this beautiful afternoon, in this sacred
place, we meet and make mention of thy name and of thy
love. We thank thee for thy great kindness to us. We confess
our great sinfulness against thee, and our utter unworthiness
before thee. We ask for the gifts of grace which thou art
ready to bestow, and we open our hearts by the leadings of thy
spirit, that thy spirit may enter in and abide with us.</p>

<p>Bless the homes we represent; bless the circles of which we
are members; bless the vast sweep of the circle with which we
are connected, and may all the members of our fraternity have
thy presence and thy grace. And with all their seeking, may
they seek spiritual power, and seeking, may they find. Enlighten
our understanding with thy wisdom, inspire our hearts
with thy love; strengthen our wills with all holy purposes.
Bring us after these reunions, and after the separations, after
all the joys and sorrows, the gains and the losses of human
life, into thine own immediate presence, and we shall praise
thee, the only God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

<p>After a song Dr. Vincent said:</p>

<p>Is any body here from Monteagle? Are any here who were
present this year at Lakeside, Monona Lake, Lake Bluff, Ocean
Grove? Have we any one here who could make us a brief
report of the C. L. S. C. work at any of these assemblies?
Where is Dr. Hurlbut? Kansas Assembly—Dr. Hurlbut presided
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hurlbut</span>: I would state that we recognized the C. L.
S. C. at Kansas, and we had a very pleasant time. When we
called for the members of the C. L. S. C. to have a meeting I
found but five, but we had a Round-Table. And the next day
we had twenty present, and when we came to the day for the
recognition of the members of ’83, we found three members of
the class. We marched the three members of ’83 in procession,
and took them down to the tabernacle and made a speech
to them. We had a number of Round-Tables, and distributed
the circulars, and a great many people said that they were going
to join. This was in Ottawa, Kansas.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of graduation an address was delivered by
Dr. G. P. Hays, an old Chautauquan, who delivered an admirable
address. In the evening we had a camp fire, and though
there were only about twenty members present, we had a fine
camp fire. We had a good place to hold it, and we gave notice
that we would admit no one but members of the C. L. S.
C., but we made an exception that any who wished to join, or
if they had any friends whom they wished to represent, or if
there were any members of the C. L. S. C. in the towns where
they lived, they might come. We made a procession three
hundred strong by actual count, all interested in the C. L. S.
C., to a greater or less degree. We had some interesting addresses.
Mr. Hatch, a member of the C. L. S. C. of that city,
made a very interesting address, and Dr. Hays spoke, and one
or two others from the places around, and we had a few solemn
words from Prof. Sherwin, and a few more solemn words from
Prof. Beard. At the close of the camp fire we found that the
C. L. S. C. stock had gone up above par. People wanted to
know all about it. One old gentleman from the country came
up to the president and said that he did not know any thing
about this C. L. S. C. that we were talking about, but he was
going to join if it did not cost more than a dollar, and he joined
that night. You will find that the next year there will be over
two hundred members of the C. L. S. C. present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: That is a very refreshing report in every
sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hurlbut</span>: I could tell you all about Island Park.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Let us hear from that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>: I could tell you about Monteagle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Let us hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>: There were some sixteen or eighteen of the
C. L. S. C. present. We did not have very many meetings,
but we met once or twice and agreed to form a procession and
give Dr. Vincent a welcome when he came. This we did.
We met in a body and called on him, and had a very pleasant
talk from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: That was not all that was done by the C. L.
S. C. at Monteagle. I was greeted very warmly by the C. L. S.
C. members at Monteagle. I found Monteagle literally a very
high place, something over 2000 feet above the sea. To my
surprise there were more than twenty members of the C. L. S.
C. at our Round-Table. Going up the mountain on the railway
a young gentleman came to me and introduced himself.
He said, “I am a member of the C. L. S. C., and my sister is a
member. She is on the train, and very anxious to see you.”
I saw her, and found her to be an enthusiastic C. L. S. C. She
knew all about the Memorial Days, and knew all about everything
in connection with the C. L. S. C. work, the C. L. S. C.
column, the news from the various states, the mottoes, and all
the special directions that had been given. She had read all
the reading for the year and much on the Seal Course. I
think she had completed the White Crystal Seal. She said she
was all alone in the town where she lived. She had done
everything that was required, even to the buying a badge, and
wearing it, and observing the five o’clock hour. She said that
next year there would be a large number from her town.</p>

<p>I am always afraid of obtruding Chautauqua on these other
centers, lest they suggest that Chautauqua be a little more
modest. I therefore do not allow the name to be used too
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hurlbut</span>: In Kansas, I know that one person wrote to
a newspaper and said that there was one evil that ought to be
nipped in the bud. He said that this evil was the peddling
around of Chautauqua ideas by professionals through the
country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: I am always sensitive about speaking too
much of Chautauqua. At Lakeside I made my first speech
without naming Chautauqua, and I did the same at Framingham,
until others came to me and said that I need not be so
particular, that they considered themselves in some degree a
part of Chautauqua. I found the same spirit at Monteagle. I
did not see a thing, or hear a syllable at Monteagle, that did
not indicate a hearty sympathy with the Chautauqua work. I
never was more royally treated.</p>

<p>At one Round-Table on errors of speech they criticised
several of my mispronunciations, and what was the worst of it,
when I sent for Webster, Webster sustained those southerners.
They got an idea that I rather enjoyed the pointing out of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
errors. We had a good time in the correction of errors in
speech. We had also a recognition speech. We formed in
procession, one graduate of ’83, and I had the satisfaction of
extending the right hand of fellowship to the one in the procession
at that service.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Lennep told me that they kept up their Round-Tables
every day until the close of the Assembly, and that they
numbered seventy strong and raised a fund of $500 toward
building a hall of philosophy at Monteagle. (Applause.)</p>

<p>This is a sort of reunion meeting; for songs, for questions, for
statements of difficulties, and for reports. Are there any large
local circles represented here? Is there a local circle of one
hundred members represented here to-day? Let the leader of
that circle stand up and raise the hand. Are there any? Mr.
Martin, of Pittsburgh, has such a circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: I would say that we have a circle in Pittsburgh
that has enrolled something like seven or eight hundred
members altogether. Occasionally one or two hundred of
them will drop out, so we do not claim that we have a circle
quite up to that number all the time. We have fifty-four
graduates enrolled as a sort of executive committee to keep up
our Local Circle movement. We have monthly meetings, and
also have numerous weekly meetings in different parts of the
city. These weekly meetings are usually reported to the central
circle, and the members attend more or less at our monthly
meetings.</p>

<p>As an alumni association, we have got up on a little higher
plane, and during the past year we held three meetings. Our
first meeting was a reunion and banquet at one of the leading
hotels. Our second meeting was a very enthusiastic one, conducted
by the members of the alumni association in the eastern
part of our city. At our last and final meeting we had Bishop
Warren to address us. We had one of the largest churches in
the city filled, and charged an admission fee as well. We felt
rich. We have a fund of about $60 to start with next year. We
expect to bring a large number of ’83 members into our
alumni association. We are still enthusiastic over the C. L. S. C.
We were enthusiastic five years ago, have been every year
since, and propose to continue to be enthusiastic as long as the
C. L. S. C. exists. (Applause.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: That is good. Is there any one here who
can make some report from Monterey Circle? They had an
unusual time last year. Is Miss Hudson present? Although
she has not been at Monterey, she has been in communication
with the Monterey people. Would you object to make a statement
as you have it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Hudson</span>: I can give a few facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Please do so. Miss Myrtie Hudson, of Ann
Arbor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Hudson</span>: I have received quite enthusiastic reports
from Monterey. There were present in July twenty-five members
to graduate. I do not know how large the class was
through the state, but they had about that number present.
The exercises held were in the hall, which was beautifully decorated
for the occasion. An address was delivered and the
diplomas were given out by Dr. Stratton, our president of the
branch of the Pacific coast. He was one of the graduates of
’83. Dr. Wythe, the author of our book on biology, was also
one of the graduates.</p>

<p>I have received this message from there to-day, that the
book, “The Hall in the Grove,” has been of very great value
in their work, and they want to make the suggestion, that it
would be a good idea to have this book read by members in
the first year, instead of the fourth year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: The suggestion of having “The Hall in the
Grove” read in the first year instead of the fourth year is a very
good one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Barlow</span>, of Detroit: I would like to speak in behalf of
“The Hall in the Grove.” I was a graduate of ’82. We have a
large circle in Detroit, but I do not know the membership, because
I have not been able to attend very frequently. Our
president of that circle, Mrs. A. L. Clark, who has been president
for five years, died this summer. I suppose that she intended
to come to Chautauqua this year. I waited here some
minutes, thinking some one else from Detroit would speak of
her. I wish you could know what a work she did in Detroit,
what an influence she had in the community of young people,
not always among the wealthy, but among those in the stores,
and those who had no other way of cultivation. No one knows
how much they owe to Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p>About “The Hall in the Grove.” I have tried in our neighborhood
for four years to organize a local circle, but have failed.
But this last summer I had two copies of “The Hall in the Grove”
which I have circulated very industriously, and I hope to organize
a circle in October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: I intended to speak at the proper time, concerning
Mrs. Clark, this devoted worker. There is no woman
in connection with our Circle who has done more hearty work.
I have received from many members of the Circle tributes to
her worth and work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Barlow</span>: Mrs. Clark had a very large class of colored
adult people that she taught every Sabbath in the Y. M. C. A.
room. They would have filled almost any house. A great
many of them have been converted, I have no doubt, from her
work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hurlbut</span>: I had the privilege last winter in Washington
City of visiting a circle composed entirely of colored people,
and I thought I should like to make a little mention of that
circle. It was a circle of between thirty and forty people of color.
They met at a private house, a handsome residence, with every
thing about it in the finest taste. The exercises that night in
that circle impressed me wonderfully. From the conversation
that I had with the members I learned that some of them were
teachers in the city of Washington, and one was a member of
the Washington Board of Education. Another had read five
times as much as we required on geology last year. One of
the city teachers read a paper of great interest. Every person
connected with the circle belonged to what we call the African
race. I never in my life was impressed with the earnestness,
thoroughness, efficiency and downright energy in the C. L. S.
C. work of any class of people more than I was on that occasion
with that of these members in Washington City.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bridge</span>: You have not spoken about New England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: At Framingham, Mass., we have an Assembly
which opens immediately after the close of Chautauqua
Assembly, and this year a little before the close. Last year we
had four hundred and forty recorded members present at that
Assembly, and the sales of the books are reported as being
double what they were the year before. And I believe the
prospects for this year are much more brilliant.</p>

<p>After various announcements Dr. Vincent said: Turn to the
nineteenth number. We must sing “Day is Dying in the
West,” or it would not seem natural. The other evening we
omitted it, and a few of us came back and sang it.</p>

<p>After the song, the Round-Table was dismissed with the
benediction by Rev. Mr. Alden.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>1. Q. What was the difference between the dispensation under
the Old Testament and the one under the New? A. The
first was a preparatory dispensation, its manifestations, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
most part, being seen and temporal; the second was a perfect
system of truth, spiritual in its character and in the methods of
its communication.</p>

<p>2. Q. What difference would there be in the methods adapted
to move men’s nature under different dispensations? A. The
same methods under all dispensations would be necessary,
varied only to suit the advancement of the mind in knowledge,
the difference existing in the habits and circumstances of men,
and the character of the dispensation to be introduced.</p>

<p>3. Q. What would be an essential requisite under any dispensation,
after the way for its introduction was prepared?
A. Such manifestations of God to men as would produce love
in the human heart for the object of worship and obedience.</p>

<p>4. Q. According to the constitution which God has given the
soul, what must it feel before it can feel love for the giver of
spiritual mercies? A. It must feel the want of spiritual mercies;
and just in proportion as the soul feels its lost, guilty and
dangerous condition, in the same proportion will it exercise
love to the being who grants spiritual favor and salvation.</p>

<p>5. Q. What is the only possible way by which man could be
made to hope for and appreciate spiritual mercies, and to love
a spiritual deliverer? A. To produce a conviction in the soul
itself of its evil condition, its danger as a spiritual being, and
its inability, unaided, to satisfy the requirements of the spiritual
law, or to escape its just and spiritual penalty.</p>

<p>6. Q. What does the degree of kindness and self-denial in a
benefactor, temporal or spiritual, create? A. The degree of
affection and gratitude that will be awakened for him.</p>

<p>7. Q. At the advent of Jesus how was the moral law generally
applied by him? A. It was applied to the external conduct
of men, not to the internal life. If there was conformity to the
letter of the law in external manners, there was a fulfillment,
in the eyes of the Jew and the Gentile, of the highest claims
that God or man held upon the spirit.</p>

<p>8. Q. How did Jesus apply the divine law? A. He taught
that all wrong thoughts and feelings were acts of transgression
against God, and as such would be visited with the penalty of
the divine law. Thus he made the law spiritual and its penalty
spiritual.</p>

<p>9. Q. What does Jesus declare to be the consequence of these
spiritual acts of transgression against God? A. Exclusion from
the kingdom and presence of God, a penalty which involves
either endless spiritual suffering, or destruction of the soul
itself.</p>

<p>10. Q. What was then necessary in order that man’s affections
might be fixed upon the proper object of love and obedience?
A. That a spiritual God should, by self-denying kindness,
manifest spiritual mercy to those who felt their spiritual
wants, and thus draw to himself the love and worship of mankind.</p>

<p>11. Q. In order to the accomplishment of this end, without
violating the moral constitution of the universe, what would be
essentially necessary? A. That the holiness of God’s law
should be maintained.</p>

<p>12. Q. What does Jesus uniformly speak of as being necessary
previous to accepting him as a Savior? A. That the soul
should feel the need of salvation.</p>

<p>13. Q. What is the testimony of the Scriptures as to God
manifesting himself in self-denying kindness for mankind? A.
The testimony of the Scriptures is that God did thus manifest
himself in Christ as suffering and making self-denials for the
spiritual good of men.</p>

<p>14. Q. What would be impossible for a human soul, exercising
full faith in the testimony of the Scriptures as to his needs
and his ransom by Christ, not to do? A. Not to love the Savior.</p>

<p>15. Q. Previous to the introduction of Christianity, in what
efforts had all the resources of human wisdom been exhausted?
A. To confer upon man true knowledge and true happiness.</p>

<p>16. Q. What are two insuperable difficulties which would forever
hinder the restoration of mankind to truth and happiness
from being accomplished by human means? A. First, human
instruction, as such, has no power to bind the conscience; and,
second, truth, whether sanctified by conscience or not, has no
power to produce love in the heart.</p>

<p>17. Q. To what are the laws which govern physical nature
analogous? A. To those which the Gospel introduces into the
spiritual world.</p>

<p>18. Q. Men can not love God for what he truly is, unless they
love him as manifested how? A. As manifested in the suffering
and death of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>19. Q. To deny the divine and meritorious character of the
atonement is to shut out what from the soul? A. Both the evidence
and the effect of God’s mercy.</p>

<p>20. Q. What is the influence of faith in Christ upon the moral
disposition of the soul? A. It assimilates the moral feelings
of man to God, and produces an aversion to sin.</p>

<p>21. Q. What is the influence of faith in Christ upon the moral
sense, or conscience of believers? A. By faith in Jesus Christ
the conscience is not only guided by a perfect rule, but it is
likewise quickened and empowered by a perfect sense of obligation.</p>

<p>22. Q. What is the influence of faith in Christ upon the imagination?
A. It controls and purifies the imagination of believers.</p>

<p>23. Q. What would a religion from heaven be designed ultimately
to bless? A. The whole world.</p>

<p>24. Q. What does the best good of mankind as a family
require? A. That they should be the instruments of disseminating
this religion among themselves.</p>

<p>25. Q. What is the great principle by which the operation of
spreading this religion would be carried on? A. The principle
of self-denial, or denying ourselves the ease and pleasure of
selfishness in order to perform acts of benevolence.</p>

<p>26. Q. How does the Gospel of Christ possess all the characteristics
of a universal religion? A. It is adapted to human
nature; not to any particular country or class of men, but to
the nature of the race.</p>

<p>27. Q. In the instructions of Christ to regulate the conduct
of men, how were their lives to be spent? A. In efforts to impart
those blessings which they possessed to their brethren of
the human family who possessed them not.</p>

<p>28. Q. In what did Christ teach the principle of self-denial?
A. By his precepts, by his example, and especially by his identifying
himself with those in need.</p>

<p>29. Q. What is faith in Jesus Christ therefore directly designed
and adapted to do and to produce? A. To strengthen
men’s benevolent affections, and to produce in believers that
active desire and effort for the good of others which will necessarily
produce a dissemination of the light and love of the Gospel
throughout the whole habitable world.</p>

<p>30. Q. What are three of the most important means of grace?
A. Prayer, praise and preaching.</p>

<p>31. Q. In order that men may receive the greatest benefit
from prayer, what is essential? A. That there should be strong
desire and importunity in prayer.</p>

<p>32. Q. In order to offer acceptable prayer, what should men
possess? A. A spirit of faith and dependence upon Christ.</p>

<p>33. Q. What are two important means to impress the mind
with religious truth? A. Music and poetry.</p>

<p>34. Q. Among the means which God appointed to disseminate
his truth throughout the world, what holds a first and important
place? A. The living preacher.</p>

<p>35. Q. What is the agency of God in carrying on the work
of redemption and giving efficiency to its operations? A. The
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>36. Q. What is evidence to the world of the divine efficacy and
power of the doctrines of the gospel system? A. Its effects in
restoring the soul to moral health.</p>

<p>37. Q. The discussion of religious subjects for the past few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
years, both in Europe and America, has been mainly between
what two classes? A. Between those who believe in the divine
authority of the Christian religion as a rule of duty, and those
who believe in the authority of conscience and reason as the
highest guides of man.</p>

<p>38. Q. How does each class receive the Messiah and his
teachings? A. One as of God, and the other as of man.</p>

<p>39. Q. In what light and as what means does one view consider
a written revelation? A. In the light of the moral wants of
man, and as adapted and necessary means in order to human
development.</p>

<p>40. Q. What proposition is attempted to be proven in this
connection? A. That a written revelation is a demand of
man’s moral constitution, without which his moral culture is
impossible.</p>

<p>41. Q. What is a first fact connected with this inquiry? A.
Man is a cultivating and a cultivable being, and he is the only
being created that possesses the double capability to receive
and to impart culture.</p>

<p>42. Q. What are three endowments by which men are particularly
distinguished from irrational beings? A. Written language,
faith and conscience.</p>

<p>43. Q. What fact is fairly settled in reference to man aiding
himself by a written language? A. That without aiding himself
by a written language man can not ascend even to the first
stages of civilization.</p>

<p>44. Q. In what way only can the character of God be known?
A. Only by faith; and it is the character of God that is the element
of moral culture.</p>

<p>45. Q. Upon what does the character of conscience in all
religious duties depend? A. Upon faith.</p>

<p>46. Q. What is said of reason, faith and conscience without
revealed truth? A. Without revealed truth reason has no data,
faith is false, and conscience is corrupt.</p>

<p>47. Q. As there can be no moral culture with a false faith
and a corrupt or dead conscience, what is a moral necessity in
order to the culture of the human soul? A. Revelation of
objective truth, rendered efficient by the perceived presence
and authority of God.</p>

<p>48. Q. What is the conclusion reached as to how the moral
culture of the soul must be accomplished? A. By a system of
truth, revealed objectively in written language, by divine authority;
and that the Christian Scriptures contain that system of
truth.</p>

<p>49. Q. In view of the reasonings and facts presented by the
author, to what conclusion is it his opinion unprejudiced readers
should come? A. That the religion of the Bible is from God,
and divinely adapted to produce the greatest present and eternal
spiritual good of the human family.</p>

<p>50. Q. Of what does he consider the demonstration conclusive?
A. That the Gospel is the only religion possible for man
in order to perfect his nature and restore his lapsed powers to
harmony and holiness.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>1. Q. What proportion of men either erect or thoroughly
well-built will be seen among those usually passing a given
point on Broadway, in New York? A. Scarcely one in ten.</p>

<p>2. Q. What is said of the training ordinarily had by farmers,
merchants, mechanics and laborers, who constitute a very great
majority of Americans? A. No one of the four classes has
ordinarily had any training at all aimed to make him equally
strong all over.</p>

<p>3. Q. What is said of regular exercise among the great majority
of the women of this country? A. No regular exercise is
common among the great majority of the women of this country
which makes them use both their hands alike, and is yet
vigorous enough to add to the size and strength of their
shoulders, chests and arms.</p>

<p>4. Q. What is the character of the popular sports and pastimes
of boyhood and youth to supply the lack of inherited development?
A. Good as these sports are, as far as they go,
they are not in themselves vigorous enough, or well enough
chosen to remedy the lack.</p>

<p>5. Q. What does a leading metropolitan journal say an inquirer
will see by standing at the door of almost any public or private
school or academy at the hour of dismissal? A. He will see a
crowd of under-sized, listless, thin-faced children, with scarcely
any promise of manhood to them.</p>

<p>6. Q. What is stated in reference to the play-grounds of our
cities and towns? A. It is not a good sign, or one that bodes
well for the future, to see them so much neglected; and many
of our large cities are wretchedly off for play-grounds.</p>

<p>7. Q. What description is given of the physical appearance
of the majority of the girls in any of our cities or towns, as seen
passing to and from school? A. Instead of high chests, plump
arms, comely figures, and a graceful and handsome mien, you
constantly see flat chests, angular shoulders, often round and
warped forward, with scrawny necks, pipe-stem arms, narrow
backs, and a weak walk.</p>

<p>8. Q. What does a distinguished surgeon say as to the ability
to endure protracted brain-work without ill result? A. It is
not brain-work that kills, but brain-worry.</p>

<p>9. Q. What does our author state there ought to be in every
girls’ school in our land, for pupils of every age? A. A system
of physical culture which should first eradicate special weaknesses
and defects, and then create and maintain the symmetry
of the pupils, increasing their bodily vigor and strength up
to maturity.</p>

<p>10. Q. What is the first thing most women should do in order
to get health and strength and the bloom of perfect physical
development? A. The first thing is to bring up the weaker
muscles by special effort, calling them at once into vigorous
action, and to restore to its proper position the shoulder, back,
or chest which has been so long allowed to remain out of place.</p>

<p>11. Q. What is the next step after the symmetry is once secured?
A. Then equal work for all the muscles, taken daily,
and in such quantities as are found to suit best.</p>

<p>12. Q. In our Christian lands what do we find in regard to
the fathers and mothers of the great men? A. We find that
the great men have almost invariably had remarkable mothers,
while their fathers were as often nothing unusual.</p>

<p>13. Q. What does our author say as to the means of getting
a vigorous and healthy body kept toned up by rational, systematic,
daily exercise, by every girl and woman? A. The
means of getting it are so easily within the reach of all who are
not already broken by disease, that it is never too late to begin,
and that one hour a day, properly spent, is all that is needed to
secure it.</p>

<p>14. Q. Had the lungs and also the muscles of the man had
vigorous daily action to the extent that frequent trial had shown
best suited to that man’s wants, of what is there very little
doubt? A. That a large majority of the ailments would be
removed, or rather would never have come at all.</p>

<p>15. Q. What is well nigh essential to attain success and
length of service in any of the learned professions, including
that of teaching? A. A vigorous body.</p>

<p>16. Q. To win lasting distinction in sedentary, in-door occupations
which tax the brain and the nervous system, what does
all professional biography teach? A. Extraordinary toughness
of body must accompany extraordinary mental powers.</p>

<p>17. Q. What are all that people need for their daily in-door
exercises? A. A few pieces of apparatus which are fortunately
so simple and inexpensive as to be within the reach of most
persons.</p>

<p>18. Q. What appliances can be readily fitted up for the home
gymnasium? A. A horizontal bar, a pair of parallel bars, or
their equivalent for certain purposes, a pair of pulling-weights,
and a rowing-weight, to which may be added a pair of dumb-bells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>19. Q. What may be accomplished with these few bits of apparatus?
A. Every muscle of the trunk, nearly all those of the
legs, and all those of the arms, can, by a few exercises so simple
that they can be learned at a single trying, be brought into
active play.</p>

<p>20. Q. To what extent should these articles of the home gymnasium
be used? A. Every member of the family, both old
and young, should use them daily, enough to keep both the
home gymnasium and its users in good working order.</p>

<p>21. Q. What is said of the shaping power of teachers with
children in school? A. When children are with their teacher
in school is almost the best time in their whole lives to shape
them as the teacher chooses, not morally or mentally only, but
physically as well.</p>

<p>22. Q. With what should prompt and vigorous steps be taken
to acquaint every school teacher in this country? A. With
such exercises as would quickly restore the misshapen, insure
an erect carriage, encourage habits of full breathing, and
strengthen the entire trunk and every limb.</p>

<p>23. Q. What did President Eliot of Harvard say a few years
ago of a majority of those coming into that university? A.
That they had undeveloped muscles, a bad carriage, and an
impaired digestion, without skill in any out-of-door games, and
unable to ride, row, swim or shoot.</p>

<p>24. Q. What do both the physician and experience tell us
rest the tired brain? A. Nothing rests a tired brain like sensible
physical exercise, except, of course, sleep.</p>

<p>25. Q. When exposure to out-of-door air is associated with a
fair share of physical exertion, what does Dr. Mitchell say it is
an immense safeguard against? A. The ills of anxiety and too
much brain work.</p>

<p>26. Q. In a country like ours, where the masses are so intelligent,
concerning what does our author consider the ignorance
of the people as marvelous? A. As to what can be done to the
body by a little systematic physical education.</p>

<p>27. Q. Of what do few people seem to be aware on this subject?
A. That any limb, or any part of it, can be developed
from a state of weakness and deficiency to one of fullness,
strength, and beauty, and that equal attention to all the limbs,
and to the body as well, will work like results throughout.</p>

<p>28. Q. What course of exercise with many has resulted in
largely reducing superfluous flesh with fleshy people? A. Vigorous
muscular exercise, taken daily and assiduously.</p>

<p>29. Q. What contributes to keeping some people thin?
A. Most thin people do not keep still enough, do not take
matters leisurely, and do not rest enough; while, if their work
is muscular, they do too much daily in proportion to their
strength.</p>

<p>30. Q. What is the character of the physical exercises the
late William Cullen Bryant continued up to the last year of his
life? A. Immediately after rising he began a series of exercises
performed with dumb-bells, a pole, a horizontal bar, and
a light chair swung around his head, continued for a full hour
and sometimes longer.</p>

<p>31. Q. What does a former business associate of Mr. Bryant,
who knew him intimately, say of his health? A. “During the
forty years that I have known him, Mr. Bryant has never been
ill—never been confined to his bed except on the occasion of
his last accident. His health has always been good.”</p>

<p>32. Q. What two classes of men are there in our cities and
larger towns that more than almost any others need daily and
systematic bodily exercise in order to make them efficient for
their duties, and something like what men in their line ought
to be? A. The police and firemen.</p>

<p>33. Q. What are some of the ways of developing the muscles
of the leg below the knee? A. Walking, and at the same time
pressing hard with the toes and the soles; running on the soles
and toes; hopping on one foot; jumping.</p>

<p>34. Q. What are some of the methods of developing the muscles
of the front thigh? A. Holding one foot out, either in
front or back, and then stooping down wholly on the other;
jumping, fast walking and running.</p>

<p>35. Q. What exercise is especially recommended for strengthening
the sides of the waist? A. Hopping straight ahead on
one foot, and then on the other.</p>

<p>36. Q. What kind of a walk does a man usually have who is
not strong in the abdominal muscles? A. A feeble walk.</p>

<p>37. Q. What is said of the development of men generally
above the waist? A. It is not an uncommon thing, especially
among Englishmen, to find a man of very strong legs and
waist, yet with but an indifferent chest and shoulders, and positively
poor arms.</p>

<p>38. Q. With the use of what can the muscles above the belt
be nearly all thoroughly developed? A. With the use of
dumb-bells.</p>

<p>39. Q. What is a simple method for improving the ordinary grip
of the hand? A. Take a rubber ball in the hand, or a wad of
any elastic material, even of paper, and repeatedly squeeze it.</p>

<p>40. Q. What will expand the chest? A. Anything which
causes one to frequently fill his lungs to their utmost capacity,
and then hold them full as long as he can.</p>

<p>41. Q. What practice of breathing is a great auxiliary to enlarging
the lung room? A. The practice of drawing air slowly
in at the nostrils until every air-cell of the lungs is absolutely
full, holding it long, and then expelling it slowly.</p>

<p>42. Q. Beside light gymnastic exercises in school, what should
a teacher insist upon with his pupils? A. He should insist upon
the value of an erect position in school hours, whether the pupils
be standing or sitting.</p>

<p>43. Q. What care should be taken in regard to school chairs?
A. That they should have broad and comfortable seats, and
that the pupil never sits on a half of the seat or on the edge of
it, but far back on the whole of it.</p>

<p>44. Q. What weight of dumb-bells should be used in ordinary
exercises with them by pupils? A. Dumb-bells of a
pound each would be fit for pupils under ten years of age. For
older pupils the same work with two pound bells will prove
generally vigorous enough.</p>

<p>45. Q. What are some of the daily exercises recommended
for girls and women? A. The use of dumb-bells, walking,
riding, and, with girls, running.</p>

<p>46. Q. Beside these things, what ought a girl or woman to
determine to do while sitting? A. To sit with the head and
neck up, trunk erect, and with the shoulders low.</p>

<p>47. Q. How ought every man in this country whose life is in-door
to divide his time? A. So that come what may he will
make sure of his hour of out-of-doors in the late afternoon, when
the day’s work is nearly or quite done.</p>

<p>48. Q. What two things ought consumptives to determine to
do when sitting? A. To sit far back on the chair, and to sit at
all times upright.</p>

<p>49. Q. To what does a great German anatomist attribute the
principal cause of pulmonary diseases? A. To the breathing
of foul air.</p>

<p>50. Q. What is it far from uncommon for delicate persons to
do who take good care of the small stock of vigor they have?
A. To outlive sturdier ones who are more prodigal and careless.</p>

<h3>LESSON V.—BIBLE SECTION.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h4><i>The World of The Bible.</i></h4>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Rev. J. L. HURLBUT, D.D., and R. S. HOLMES, A.M.</span></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Upon a map of the world mark out a section between 42°
and 27° north latitude, and 54° and 12° east longitude (Greenwich).
This will include a rectangle having the Black Sea on
the north; the Caspian and Persian Gulf on the east, the
Sinaitic peninsula on the south, and Rome on the west; a section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of 1050 miles north and south, by 2400 east and west; an area
of 2,520,000 square miles, about two-thirds the size of the
United States. Within these limits were transacted all the
events of Bible history. This area should be considered in
connection with two maps, overlapping each other in the center,
those of the Old Testament, and the New Testament world.</p>

<p>I. The Old Testament world will embrace the lands between
54° and 31° east longitude, or from the Nile to the Persian
Gulf; and between 42° and 27° north latitude, or from the
Black Sea to the Red Sea.</p>

<p>1. Observe the location of the following <i>Seas</i>, and draw such
portions of them as are included in the map. 1. The Caspian,
in the northeast corner. 2. The Persian Gulf, southeast corner.
3. The Red Sea, on the south. 4. The Mediterranean
Sea, on the west. 5. The Black Sea on the north. 6. The
Dead Sea, due north of the eastern arm of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>2. Locate the following <i>Mountain Ranges</i>: 1. Mount Ararat,
the nucleus of the mountain system, situated between the
Caspian, Black, and Mediterranean. 2. The Caspian range,
branching from Ararat eastward, and following the border of
the Caspian Sea. 3. Mount Zagras, running from Ararat
southeasterly, toward the Persian Gulf. 4. Mount Lebanon,
from Ararat southwesterly, toward the Red Sea. (Anti-Lebanon,
the mountains of Palestine, Mount Seir and Mount Sinai,
are all parts of this great range.) 5. Mount Taurus, from Ararat
westward, following the northern shore of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>3. Next draw the important <i>Rivers</i>, nearly all following the
line of the mountain ranges. 1. The Araxes, from eastward
into the Caspian Sea. 2. The Tigris, called in the Bible Hiddekel,
from Ararat, following the Zagras Mountain, into the
Persian Gulf. 3. The Euphrates, from Ararat westward to
Mount Taurus, then southward, following the course of Lebanon,
then southeasterly through the great plain, until it unites
with the Tigris. 4. The Orontes, between two parallel chains
of the Lebanon range northward into the Mediterranean. 5.
The Jordan, between the same chains of Lebanon southward
into the Dead Sea. 6. The Nile, in Africa, northward into the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>4. This world has its great Natural Divisions, somewhat like
those of the United States. 1. The eastern slope, from Mount
Zagras eastward to the great desert. 2. The central plain,
between Zagras and Lebanon. 3. The Mediterranean Slope,
between Lebanon and the great sea.</p>

<p>5. These natural divisions suggest the arrangement of the
<i>Lands</i>. 1. Locate the lands of the eastern slope; Armenia,
Media, Persia. 2. The lands of the central plain, as follows:
Between Mount Zagras and the river Tigris. Assyria and
Elam; between the Tigris and Euphrates. Mesopotamia and
Chaldea; the great desert. Arabia; between the desert and
Lebanon, Syria. 3. The lands of the Mediterranean; Egypt,
the wilderness, Palestine, Phœnicia, Asia Minor, though the
last does not appear in Old Testament history.</p>

<p>6. Locate the following cities, and name the Bible events
associated with them. 1. Eden, the original home of the
human race, probably at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates.
2. Babylon, the capital of Chaldea, on the Euphrates.
3. Shushan, or Suza, the capital of Persia, and the place
of Esther’s deliverance. 4. Nineveh, on the Tigris, the capital
of Assyria. 5. Haran, in Mesopotamia, a home of Abraham.
6. Damascus, the capital of Syria. 7. Jerusalem, in Palestine.
8. Tyre, in Phœnicia. 9. Memphis, on the Nile, in Egypt.</p>

<p>II. <i>The New Testament World.</i> This extends from Asia
Minor to Italy, and from the Black Sea to Mount Sinai, between
the same parallels as the last map, and from 12° to 42° east
longitude; and represents the lands of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>1. Upon this map locate five <i>Seas</i>. The Mediterranean; Dead
Sea; Black Sea; Ægean Sea (between Asia Minor and Europe);
Adriatic Sea, between Greece and Italy.</p>

<p>2. Locate also five <i>Islands</i>. Cyprus, in the northeastern corner
of the Mediterranean; Crete, south of the Ægean; Patmos,
in the Ægean; Sicily, southwest of Italy, and Melita, now
Malta, south of Sicily.</p>

<p>3. Arrange and bound the lands by their continents. 1.
African lands. Egypt, Libya, and Africa proper. 2. Asiatic
lands. Palestine, Phœnicia, Syria, Asia Minor. 3. European
lands. Macedonia, Greece, Illyricum, Italy.</p>

<p>4. Locate definitely the provinces of Asia Minor, which may
be arranged thus: Three on the north, bordering on the Black
Sea. Pontus, Paphlagonia, Bithynia; three on the west, bordering
on the Ægean Sea. Mysia, Lydia, Caria; three on the
south, bordering on the Mediterranean; Lycia, Pamphylia,
Cilicia; four in the interior; north, Galatia; east, Cappadocia;
south, Pisidia; west, Phrygia; central, Lycaonia.</p>

<p>5. Notice the location of several important <i>Cities</i>. Alexandria,
in Egypt; Jerusalem, in Palestine; Damascus and Antioch,
in Syria; Tyre, in Phœnicia; Tarsus, in Cilicia; Ephesus,
in Lydia; Philippi and Thessalonica, in Macedonia; Athens
and Corinth, in Greece; and Rome, in Italy.</p>

<p>6. Notice with regard to the New Testament world. 1. There
were many lands, yet but one government, the Roman Empire.
2. There were many tongues, yet one language everywhere
spoken, the Greek. 3. There were many races, but one people
found everywhere, the Jews. 4. There were many religions,
yet no deep-seated belief, and consequently, everywhere a hunger
for the Gospel.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY-SCHOOL SECTION.</h3>

<h4>LESSON IV.—THE TEACHER’S WEEK-DAY WORK.</h4>

<p>I. <i>Its Necessity.</i>—The teacher’s purpose is the conversion and
spiritual education of the scholar; a purpose too great to be
compassed in the session of the Sunday-school. Consider the
following facts:</p>

<p>1. <i>The brief time which the Sunday-school affords; a half
hour</i> to the lesson; fifty-two half hours in a year; less than
one school week of the secular school. What progress could
be expected from a year’s study, in which the school time is
only a week?</p>

<p>2. <i>The difficult subjects of Sunday-school teaching</i>; upon
themes which are the loftiest contemplated by the human mind;
worthy of the ablest intellects; yet to be simplified to the
understanding of childhood and youth by the teacher.</p>

<p>3. <i>The lack of preparation on the part of the pupil.</i>—The
teacher can not take for granted <i>any</i> study at home by the
class, but must supplement their absolute neglect by his own
increased diligence and skill.</p>

<p>4. <i>The natural aversion of the scholar’s heart to the teacher’s
efforts.</i>—The pupil does not desire to be saved and to learn
about salvation; all his unregenerate nature is hostile to the
subject, and the teacher has dull hearts as well as unprepared
minds to contend against.</p>

<p>5. <i>The intervening time of a week between the sessions of the
school</i> is sufficient to efface even what impression is produced
by the lesson.</p>

<p>With all these hindrances it is plain that the teacher who is
to succeed, must supplement his Sunday with week-day work.</p>

<p>II. The next question is, <i>What shall the week-day work of
the teacher be?</i> Our space forbids more than a mere outline.</p>

<p>1. <i>A daily study by the teacher of teaching methods</i>, in order
to best employ the brief time at command for actual work. It
is said Napoleon’s battles were fought in detail in his own mind
before even the enemy were in sight, and his force, will and
genius were sufficient to carry out the details. A study of the
methods employed by the best secular teachers would furnish
means for planning all the details of any Sunday half hour.</p>

<p>2. <i>A daily study of the lesson itself.</i>—The teacher’s preparation
will occupy another lesson in this series; but when once
that art has been learned, a part of the teacher’s week-day
work should be to practice it daily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>A daily watching the methods of life of the class of society
from which one’s pupils come.</i>—If they are children or youth or
adults, if from the lower, middle or higher walks of society, the
teacher should know the influences which surround the life and
the methods which govern it, in order to rightly fit the teaching
to the life.</p>

<p>4. <i>A sedulous scrutiny of the face of every child met in daily
life.</i>—Such care will prevent ever passing a scholar of the class
without notice, and will reveal the workings of the child heart,
and give an insight into child nature that will be of great value.</p>

<p>5. <i>A careful listening to the conversation of children, and
entering into conversation with them whenever practicable.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>Earnestly seeking an interest in the things which are of
interest to the pupil.</i>—It will furnish a common ground of meeting
in the class on Sunday. <i>Community of interest will result.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Daily seeking contact with the pupil, either personal or by
some means which will recall the teacher to the pupil’s mind.</i>—If
the teacher is daily present with the pupil there is hope that
the teacher’s influence and teachings will be also.</p>

<p>8. <i>Daily endeavoring by all means in the teacher’s power to
render the pupil’s daily life pleasanter.</i></p>

<p>III. But how can all these things be accomplished?</p>

<p>1. By a regular attendance on the weekly teachers’ meeting.
That is an essential part of a teacher’s week-day work.</p>

<p>2. By systematic visiting of pupils in their homes. This will
insure an acquaintance which could in no other way be obtained.</p>

<p>3. By cultivating the reading habit in the pupil. How? By
giving some good weekly paper or magazine which you have
finished; by loaning good books; by interesting the family in
such organizations as the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle.</p>

<p>4. By inviting pupils to entertainments, to the teacher’s home
in winter, and to the woods and fields in summer.</p>

<p>5. By establishing little class Normal classes, and teaching
some of the many interesting things parallel to the general
work of the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>This brief outline may serve as a nucleus for thought by the
student, and may suggest a general plan, of which the details
can be wrought out by the individual teacher.</p>

<h4>LESSON V.—THE TEACHER’S PREPARATION.</h4>

<p>I. <i>The Necessity of Preparation.</i>—All that was adduced in
the last lesson to show the importance of the week-day work,
might well be repeated as arguments for the preparation of the
lesson.</p>

<p>1. <i>It is necessary from the limitation of time.</i>—The teacher
must study his subject thoroughly, in order to employ to the
utmost that precious half hour of the lesson.</p>

<p>2. <i>It is necessary from the nature of the subjects.</i>—No one
should venture to instruct upon the all-important, the profound,
the difficult themes of the Gospel, who has not given them special
and intense thought.</p>

<p>3. <i>It is necessary from the condition of the pupil.</i>—Because
the scholar is unprepared, careless, unthinking, the teacher
must be alert, able, equipped. Any one can teach a genius,
but it requires a genius to teach a dullard.</p>

<p>II. <i>The general aims of preparation.</i>—In the teacher’s study
of the Scripture three aims should at all times be kept in view.</p>

<p>1. <i>His first aim should be to interpret the meaning of the
Word.</i>—We should study, not to interject into the Scriptures
our own views, or the doctrines of our school of thought, but to
ascertain what God meant in the Book, to learn “the mind of
the Spirit.”</p>

<p>2. <i>His second aim should be to satisfy the needs of his own
spiritual nature.</i>—No man can feed others unless he has himself
been fed. Let the teacher fill his own heart with the
Word of life, and then he will be able to inspire his class with
hunger for the truth.</p>

<p>3. <i>His third aim should be to supply the needs of his class.</i>—He
is a teacher as well as a learner, and must ever study with
the full knowledge of his scholar’s needs, seeking in the lesson
for that which is especially fitted for them and can be adapted
to them.</p>

<p>III. <i>The Departments of Preparation.</i>—(We condense here
the outline of Dr. Vincent, in the “Chautauqua Normal Guide.”)
There are five lines of investigation and preparation to be followed
by the teacher; not necessarily in this order, but embodying
these departments.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Analysis of the Lesson-Text.</i>—The teacher who seeks
to know the contents of the lesson will find them under the following
seven elements. 1. The <i>time</i> to which the lesson
belongs, year, period, relation to last lesson, etc. 2. The <i>places</i>
referred to in the lesson, or where its events occurred; their
location, history, associations. 3. The <i>persons</i>, who they were;
what is known of them; the characters displayed. 4. The
<i>facts</i> or <i>thoughts</i> of the lesson; facts if historical; thoughts if
ethical or doctrinal, as the Epistles. 5. The <i>difficulties</i> encountered
in the explanation of the lesson, whether in its statements,
or their relation to other parts of Scripture. 6. The <i>doctrines</i>
or general principles taught. 7. The <i>duties</i> inculcated in the
lesson or to be drawn from it.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Collation of Parallel Passages.</i>—Every text which will
shed light upon a fact or a thought in the lesson should be
searched. Spurgeon says: “The best commentary on a passage
of Scripture is the spirit of God;” and that it reveals
itself in the parallel passages.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Exploration of the Lesson-Text</i>, for its central topic;
the underlying spiritual thought which runs through it and is to
be presented from it.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Adaptation of the Lesson to the Class.</i>—This subject
receives more full and suggestive treatment in Lesson vii. The
teacher must prepare his lesson with the condition and characteristics
of his pupils in his mind.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Preparation of the Teaching Plan.</i>—The teacher
should know not only what he is to teach, but <i>how</i> he is to
teach it; in what order of thought; with what opening sentences,
illustrations, application, and closing utterances.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Hints on Preparation.</i>—1. Begin early in the week, as soon
after the teaching of the last lesson as possible. 2. Read the
lesson often; at least once each day, and thoughtfully. 3. Pray
much over the lesson; for by communion with the Author of
the Word we enter into knowledge of the Word. 4. Use all
the helps accessible, in the line of commentaries, Bible dictionaries,
etc. 5. Study independently, using the thoughts of others
to quicken your own thought, and not in place of it. 6.
Talk with others about the lesson, in the family, in the teachers’
meeting, and in social life. 7. Do not expect to use all your
material. All the knowledge gained will add power to the
teaching of that portion of the knowledge imparted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Art of Reading.</span>—I used to believe a great deal more in
opportunities and less in application than I do now. Time and
health are needed, but with these there are always opportunities.
Rich people have a fancy for spending money very uselessly on
their culture because it seems to them more valuable when it has
been costly; but the truth is, that by the blessing of good and
cheap literature, intellectual light has become almost as accessible
as daylight. I have a rich friend who travels more, and buys
more costly things than I do, but he does not really learn more
or advance farther in the twelvemonth. If my days are fully
occupied, what has he to set against them? only other well occupied
days, no more. If he is getting benefit at St. Petersburg
he is missing the benefit I am getting round my house
and in it. The sum of the year’s benefit seems to be surprisingly
alike in both cases. So if you are reading a piece of
thoroughly good literature, Baron Rothschild may possibly be
as well occupied as you—he is certainly not better occupied.
When I open a noble volume I say to myself, “now the only
Crœsus that I envy is he who is reading a better book than
this.”—<i>Philip G. Hamerton.</i></p>

<h3>DRESS AND INCOME</h3>

<p>Dress is fast becoming a science. Particularly is this true of
the dress of women. The modern fashion magazine with its
suggestions and plans, shows how nearly dress is a formulated
science. All this is right and necessary. When used rightly
there is no weapon in a woman’s hands more powerful than effective
dressing. It makes even a plain woman attractive, and a
fair one doubly so. It gives her a peculiar influence which every
earnest, true-hearted woman should seek rather than avoid.
To be effective, dress must be studied. But the thought which
women give to dress leads them often to give it undue importance,
to make it a paramount object rather than a means to
influence. Most especially is this true among a large class of
self-supporting women and wives of salaried men. The old
charge of Polonius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</div>
<div class="verse i1">But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">is often literally carried out by them, and in many cases this
class dresses in a more costly style and with more taste than
any other in the community. Nor is it mere outside show.
They do not wear silk dresses and coarse boots, nor velvet
mantles and no gloves. Their wardrobe is almost invariably
complete and in taste. They are sensibly, neatly and richly
dressed women. They have studied and mastered the science
of dressing well. They live within their incomes, too; but in
almost every case their salaries give them nothing but food
and raiment. At the end of a year, beyond their wardrobes
and the amount of rather questionable prestige which their
good clothes have given them in a certain circle—rarely a circle
which is superior to their own—they have nothing, and here lies
the wrong. No matter how small an income may be it ought
to be so used that it will do more. If for a year’s work we have
simply the necessaries of life, we have achieved small success.
But few people put their money where it yields substantial return;
few devote a fair portion of their earnings to increase the
value of their work or to multiply implements of work. We
rarely find persons who devote a fair amount of their salaries to
charities, but we do often find salaries of from six hundred to
one thousand dollars yielding seal-skin sacks and velvet
gowns. Are such garments consistent with the steady course of
self-culture which every person should pursue, or with the tithe
which every moralist, not to say Christian, should devote to the
world of woe about us? Common sense tells us that we can
not live like the wealthy unless we are wealthy.</p>

<p>It is among the salaried class particularly that this evil
exists. Perhaps the cause springs from the way in which they
earn their livelihood. Money comes to them regularly and
surely; they see no reason why it should cease, and so give less
attention to strict economy than the man whose success depends
upon the care and thrift with which he lives. Their future
promotion depends upon their faithfulness, not upon their
economy, so that often a man of moderate salary keeps a more
expensive establishment than a man of moderate wealth. In
the latter case future business advancement depends upon the
amount he can save to invest, in the former simply upon his
sticking to his work. Salaried people too often live like school
boys upon their annual allowance. Whatever the cause, there
is a large class of people among us much inferior to what they
might be, both in usefulness and ability, simply from the wholly
selfish expenditures of their incomes.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>STEAM IS NOT AN ARISTOCRAT.</h3>

<p>One of the careless outcries of dissatisfied persons is that the
“rich are growing richer and the poor poorer.” This is half
true. The rich are growing richer—and so, too, are the poor.
The wealth of the world has been enormously increased, and
all classes have profited by it. Even paupers fare better at
public expense than they did fifty years ago. Steam has multiplied
the world’s wealth. The increase is most conspicuous
in the bank accounts of the rich. But the poor live in better
houses, have better food and clothing, and get a good many
things once considered luxuries. Doubtless some who cry
“the poor are growing poorer,” have an honest fear that the
tendency of things is to crush down into bitter poverty all but
the few rich. They see the growth of large fortunes, but they
fail to see the greater growth of general wealth, nor do they
stop to figure out the problem. For example: Suppose Vanderbilt
has $150,000,000. Then suppose it divided among 50,000,000
of people. We should get just <i>three dollars apiece</i>!
Suppose that the very rich of the country are equal in wealth
to twenty Vanderbilts—a very large estimate. Then, their
united wealth, if distributed, would give us only <i>sixty dollars
apiece</i>! That is the most we could get out of dividing up the
big piles of wealth. Any one sees that it would not pay to
divide. The rich have not a great deal of our money in their
pockets—if they have any. For, an honest inquiry will show
that the general average of wealth, and of all that wealth brings
to us, is higher by a much larger proportion than that sixty dollars
apiece represents. The worst view we can possibly take
of it is that we have paid sixty dollars apiece, out of a vast increase
in wealth, to men who have managed great enterprises
that have enriched us all. <i>Perhaps</i> these men have taken it
all for nothing. Nobody believes it; but suppose they have.
Then we have still obtained a great gain at small cost. We
get, on the average, twice as much for our labor as people did
fifty years ago. We live in more comfort than people used to
do. We are not growing poorer. We raise here no question
of monopolies. Our point now is that the poor are not growing
poorer, but richer—that there is no such tendency at work in
modern society as the one honestly feared by many—this
piling up of all wealth in few hands. Steam is not an aristocrat,
but a plain Republican who impartially helps us all when we
help ourselves.</p>

<h3>THE PRESENT POLITICAL OUTLOOK.</h3>

<p>In a very few months we shall know the names of the presidential
candidates, one of whom, in all probability, will be the
next chief executive of the nation. The Republican National
Convention has been called to meet in Chicago June 3, next.
The calling of other conventions will soon follow. In a short
time we shall have the candidates, and then will ensue a contest
of which it is safe to predict that it will be close, exciting,
and warmly fought. In contemplating the present political
situation, we see it is little different from that of 1880. Less
change has come in the quadrennium than might have been
anticipated. The same two great parties confront each other,
and their apparent relative strength is much the same as it was
when last in the national arena they measured swords; it can
hardly be said that there is greater likelihood of the success of
either than there was four years ago. For years there has been
no little talk about the old parties having done their work, and
the time having come for them to die and new parties to succeed
them; and yet, we enter the presidential campaign of
1884 with the two old parties in the field as influential as ever.
Small progress, if any, has been made during the past four
years in the work of bringing new parties to strength and prominence.
The supersession of the parties which for so many
years have been competitors for the reins of government is a
thing of the future still, and seems a thing not of the near future.
Of the new political organizations which from time to
time have arisen, it is to be said that, generally, their strength
is evidently waning rather than increasing. Some of them, in
state elections, have held the balance of power and been important
factors, but there is no probability that such will be the
case in the approaching presidential contest. The influential
parties of the past are the influential parties of the present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
One of them is to win in November next, and both now appear
with about the same chances of success as in 1880.</p>

<p>The fall elections of 1882 gave great confidence to the Democratic
party. Their ticket in New York received 192,000 majority,
in Pennsylvania 40,000, and in Massachusetts 14,000.
They had some grounds certainly for the assurance that in the
next presidential fight they would wrest from their opponents
the power which had been theirs for more than a score of years.
But the situation has taken on a decidedly changed aspect.
From the state elections of October last, indeed, Democrats
might still derive courage and hope. They carried Ohio, and
showed much greater strength in Iowa than in former years;
though, to be sure, causes for these results of a local and temporary
character were not wanting. But the November elections
served to render the prospects more dubious. In New
York the Republicans elected their candidate for Secretary of
State by 17,000 majority; in Pennsylvania their state ticket was
carried by a majority of 16,000; and in Massachusetts Mr.
Robinson was elected Governor over General Butler by a majority
of 10,000. Virginia was carried by the Democrats; but
this Democratic victory, it is well argued by a keen political
writer, is to prove a real blessing to the Republicans by breaking
the complications of their party with “Mahoneism” and
repudiation. All things considered, then, neither party can be
seen to have gained since the last presidential election, and to
stand a better chance of success than four years ago. The
“Solid South” is still solid. Not an electoral vote from the
states once in rebellion will be given to the Republican candidates.
Among many doubtful things, this at least is certain.
The solid vote of the South is secure in the hands of the Democrats.
In addition to this, they will need, to win, forty-five
electoral votes from the North. If they are successful in securing
these, the next incumbent of the presidential office will be
a Democrat. The result of the approaching contest, since
party issues of account are now notably wanting, must turn
very much upon the character of the party candidates and the
personal and official conduct of the representatives of the two
parties at Washington in the intervening time. From what has
been seen in New York, Pennsylvania, and other states, it is
evident that there is a very large and growing body of voters
in the land who will not be fettered to party, whether right or
wrong. They claim the right to turn their backs upon their
party when its action becomes offensive, and take an independent
position. These “independents” hold the balance of
power at the present time. They can give New York and
Pennsylvania to either party; they can fix the result of the
presidential election. If good behavior on the part of party
leaders and the choice of unexceptionable candidates will secure
their votes, it will certainly be good policy to make use of
the measures.</p>

<h3>SPANISH BULL FIGHTS.</h3>

<p>There are found, even where we have the best civilization,
some degraded classes who delight in cruel, bloody sports, in
witnessing scenes most revolting to persons of humane feelings
and better culture. But desperadoes, pugilists, and other fighting
men, with those who have a fiendish satisfaction in the sufferings
and blood of the dumb animals they torture, are counted
alien from our Christian civilization. Their characters and
their crimes are detested by all good citizens. But when deeds
of cruelty and blood are not only endured and condoned, but
raised to the dignity of national sports, it shows a state of society
that can hardly be called civilized. Ancient Rome had
her gladiatorial shows for the gratification of those eager to
witness the bloody spectacle. The tournaments of chivalrous
knights in the mediæval times, who slew each other as an exhibition
of their strength and skill, were of the same character.
In Spain and Portugal even to the present day bull fights are
a national amusement, in which nearly all classes find pleasure.
Our attention is just now called to this. A suggestive note
from a gentleman of culture and refined sensibilities, says: “A
king of Spain brought home a young wife, whose first duty was
to give the signal for the beginning of a bull fight. The same
monarch is visited by a German prince, in whose honor these
brutalities are perpetrated on a more magnificent scale than
usual.” And so it is. Alas for European civilization in the
nineteenth century!</p>

<p>The preparation for these sports is extensive. The ring is of
vast dimensions, in the center of which is a pit, or wide area,
sunk in terraced granite, with galleries rising on all sides, sufficient
to seat at least ten thousand people who usually crowd the
place on Sabbath afternoon. The fighters and their assistants
are trained to their business, and handle their weapons skillfully.
Some are mounted on horses with long slender spears,
used simply to torture and exasperate, but to inflict no deadly
wound. The “killer” is a swordsman on foot, who baffles and
confuses the bull, drawing his attention this way and that, playing
his red cloak before his eyes, and watching his opportunity
to plunge the sword to the hilt into the neck of the animal.
They are well paid, and often amass large fortunes. But no
verbal account of a bull tourney can present the rapid changes,
the dangers and escapes, the skill, the picturesqueness, and the
horror of the actual thing. The acts, brilliant or repulsive,
occur in rapid succession, presenting only glimpses of dramatic,
ghastly pictures, which fade out instantly to re-form in new
phases. The poor, gaunt, dilapidated horses used are a cheap
contribution to the occasion, and forced into position to be
killed by the horns of the bull, as he, in turn, is doomed to die
by the sword of the killer, with not the slightest chance to survive
the bloody fray. A fierce, powerful bull has been known to
kill five horses in ten minutes. The first rush against a horse is
a sight horrible to witness. You hear the horns tearing the
tough hide, crashing the ribs, dragging the entrails from the
quivering body. When two or more of the poor animals are
struggling on the earth in the ring, now reeking with blood,
others, with bandaged eyes, and hideously gashed sides, are
spurred and goaded on to a similar fate. A witness tells of
seeing “a horse and rider lifted bodily on the horns, and so
tossed that the horseman was flung from his saddle, hurtled
over the bull, and landed solidly on his back, senseless.” The
grooms bore him off white and rigid, but the eager spectators
heeded him not. They were wildly cheering the bull’s strength
and prowess. Occasionally a man is horribly mangled, killed
in the ring, or maimed for life; so a surgeon attends in the
ante-room, and (alas! the mockery,) a priest is at hand,
with his holy wafer for the last sacrament in case of any accident
to a good bull-fighting Catholic. Yet things so unutterably
repulsive are witnessed with apparent delight by
richly dressed Spanish gentlemen and ladies of the highest
rank.</p>

<p>The performance, as at present maintained, is far below that
of other days, when the nation had more vigor. The dumb
animals are, by arrangements in the ring, put to a much greater
disadvantage, and the necessity for great dexterity and courage
no longer existing, the class of fighting men do not, in these
respects, compare well with their predecessors.</p>

<p>Spain, once a powerful nation, having a class—not numerous—of
highly cultivated citizens, and a literature by no means
despicable, has fallen into a sad condition, neither respected
nor feared as formerly. The brutal sports in which she delights
could never be introduced or tolerated in really refined society,
or by cultured people, but when retained as a relic of earlier
barbarism they have an educating force, and nurture to still
greater strength the evil passions that made them possible.
Some things among us may have a dissipating, if not demoralizing,
tendency, and should be abandoned. Our voice is not
against all amusements. Innocent recreations are healthy. Our
minds and bodies need them. Only let them be suitable, and
of an elevating tendency.</p>

<p>The presidential campaign for 1884 was opened in December
by the Republican National Committee fixing June as the
time, and Chicago as the place for holding the National Convention.
Chautauqua was discussed as a proper place for this
convention to meet. The <i>Graphic</i>, of New York, furnished a
number of good illustrations of the hotels, steamboats, and
lines of railroads with which the Lake is favored, but these attractions
were not strong enough—the atmosphere of the place
is not the kind political conventions breathe. To be sure,
President Grant and President Garfield both honored themselves
and Chautauqua by visiting the Assembly, but a national
political convention, even of the Republican type, would
find “water, water, everywhere,” and nothing stronger to
drink. Chautauqua is dead as a place for holding a national
political convention.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell, our Minister to England, enjoys so
excellent a reputation in that country, that people who ought
to know better, are beginning to talk about his “Un-Americanism.”
It is a foolish business. Mr. Lowell is an American of
the Americans. But Americanism does not consist in a capacity
for getting the ill-will of foreigners, or in abusing them
when one lives abroad. Mr. Lowell worthily represents the
people of the United States among the English people, and the
honors paid to him in choosing him to unveil the statue of
Fielding, and electing him Rector of the University of Glasgow,
are honors paid to this nation. There is no place for the petty
jealousy of his growing popularity in England. It is a thing
to be proud of. The author of the “Biglow Papers” will always
be known on both sides of the ocean as a Yankee of the
Yankees.</p>

<p>Somebody has said of the “House of Representatives,” “it
is too big for business, too big for harmony, too big for economy,
too big for any practical purpose whatever,” and the
prospect is that it will be larger, rather than smaller. Speaker
Carlisle found it almost unwieldy when he organized the four
hundred and one members into committees. We venture the
assertion that no officer in the United States Government in his
official capacity passes through a more trying ordeal than the
Speaker of the House. He must face his work every day of
the session, in the hall where he presides; and as for ambition
and jealousy, tact and skill in manipulation, the representatives
of the people are so well along in all these things that to ask
one man to appoint this company to places on committees, and
then to legislate for the people, is too much. A new method of
appointing committees ought to be adopted.</p>

<p>Mr George Ticknor Curtis has rendered the American public
a valuable service in his two volumes on the life of James
Buchanan, published by the Harper Brothers. If this material
had been precipitated upon the public mind in the dark days
of the civil war, it would have been as fuel to the flame of public
passion, or if it had come to light even during the years immediately
after the war, the result would have been much the
same. Mr. Buchanan’s task during the last days of his administration
was a hard one. He was expected to both <i>wait</i> and
to be in a <i>hurry</i> in discharging his duties as President; besides,
it required more than human sagacity to determine what would
be the wisest course for his administration to pursue. The
time when he vacated the White House, and Mr. Lincoln went
into it, makes a joint in American history which must be studied
as with a microscope, if the student would reach a correct judgment
of the men who acted and the events that transpired.
The correspondence which passed between Mr. Buchanan and
several members of his old cabinet, after he retired to private
life is like the glare of an electric light turned on those turbulent
times. By these letters one can read his way out of the
heretofore inexplicable darkness of those caverns of history.</p>

<p>John Brown, of Ossawatomie fame, has been glorified in
poetry and song. There has been a bewitching charm about
his name to a multitude of people, and the events of the past
decade have contributed largely to this spell. As we settle
back into our normal condition and study the naked facts of
his history, we are led to wonder how the man exerted such a
tremendous influence over his countrymen. If it be true that
Sherman, Doyles and Wilkinson, with others, whom Brown and
his men murdered, had entered into a conspiracy to destroy the
Browns, this did not justify John Brown and his men for murdering
them in cold blood. Not even in warfare would such
heartless butchery be defensible. It may yet appear that the
endorsement which the American people gave to John Brown,
and the glory they have attached to his memory were unworthily
bestowed, and that the people were misled. The close study
of American history as made between 1858 and 1865 may put a
new face on many of our biographical and national stories of
men and events.</p>

<p>John Pender, a member of the English Parliament, compliments
the Western Union Telegraph Company, in a speech on
the government assuming control of telegraph lines, in these
words: “I have thought it desirable to refer to my visit to
America, and say something about the Western Union system,
because it is a system which is, probably, in its efficiency, only
to be compared with our own system in England, which is
worked by the Government, with this difference, that being
worked as a private enterprise, and being stimulated more or
less by competition, I think the Western Union has shown
greater results during the last ten years than our system has
under government management. I think the science of electricity
has received more encouragement and been more developed,
and the reduction of rates has, during that time, also
been greater in America than in England; and, altogether, I
think it would be well if our Government took a leaf out of the
book of the Western Union Company.”</p>

<p>The London (England) <i>Chronicle</i> speaks the following sensible
words concerning the new honor conferred on Tennyson:

Tennyson as Lord Tennyson, and he is too aged, and his life-impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
too decidedly fixed, for the changed name to get
established. Just as we speak of Shakspere, and Wordsworth,
and Bulwer Lytton, and Browning, so we shall think and speak
of Tennyson. A poet’s proper crown is not a peerage, but a
nation’s admiration and love, and the world’s uplifting by his
words of trust and hope, his visions of the perfect, the beautiful,
and the true, his subtle readings of human hearts and motives.
England, and the English speaking races of the world,
crowned Tennyson long ago, and the peerage crown seems but
a little thing, only needing a passing word.”</p>

<p>Among the many “happy ideas” hit upon in connection with
the C. L. S. C., that of Memorial Days deserves prominent
place and mention. Several of these days are named for men
whose genius and literary greatness have received the world’s
recognition. These days are not memorials to the cold letters
that spell the names of Milton, Addison, and Shakspere, but to
genius and greatness in literature as represented by them. And
the design is not to keep in memory a mere literal sign, a
name, but to pay our homage to the literary or other merit with
which the name is associated. And this with the ulterior view
of kindling aspirations and inspirations in our own minds and
hearts.</p>

<p>Seventy-five million dollars are invested in the rubber business
of this country, of which $30,000,000 are in the boot and shoe
manufacture. The annual products are $250,000,000, made by
15,000 persons at 120 factories. Thirty thousand tons of raw
rubber are used each year. The forests along the equator, which
Humboldt declared inexhaustible, are dwindling, and the rapid
increase of cost of rubber (from 50 cents to $1.25 per lb. in six
years) is leading to search for cheaper substitutes.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. John Hall says: “The churches of New York
cost $3,000,000 per year; the amusements $7,000,000; the city

the churches should have more money.”</p>

<p>Ella A. Giles, in <i>The Nation</i>, furnishes a description of a
seminary for colored girls in Atlanta, Ga., under the auspices
of the Baptist Home Missionary Society. Here is a testimony
she jotted down in one of their meetings: “Dis chile didn’t do
no teachin’ in vacation,” said a big mulatto woman, with great
pomposity. “’Twan’t ’cos she didn’t know ’nuff, ’xactly, nor
’cos there wasn’t heaps dat needed to be teached. On every
side ignorant niggers is as thick as flies. But my <i>preferment</i>
was doin’ suthin’ else fur my blessed Savior. Needn’t think I
didn’t work for Jesus, my young sisters. I tell ye I worked
mighty hard! I visited heaps o’ sick niggers, an’ I ’low I wan’t
lazy. Don’t win ye no crown jes to go an’ <i>look</i> at sick folks,
unless ye <i>do</i> suthin’ fur um. I feel like as if my stomach was
light and freed from bile, ’cos I nussed the sick, an’ puttin my
shoulder to the wheel, didn’t look back like Lot’s wife and turn
unto a pillow of salt, but minded my blessed Lord an’ Savior
an’ visited the sick—fur to please Jesus. I likes dis yeah
school. Laws! I’s mo’n fifty years ole or thar-’bouts, an’ till I
kum yeah I nebber know’d dat workin’ fur Christ meant nussin’
sick folks an’ goin’ to see the widowers an’ childless in
affliction, an’ keepin’ unspotted from de world.”</p>

<p>One cold day in December, from the City Hall steps in New
York City, the Rev. Henry Kimball gave away two cheeses,
cut in pound chunks, two barrels of crackers, a barrel of turnips,
a barrel of hominy done up in brown paper pound packages,
and five bags of Indian meal. One hundred and twenty
women, seventy little girls, and a colored man came to get
their baskets filled. “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”</p>

<p>At a meeting of naturalists held recently in New York, Prof.
D. Cope, of Philadelphia, alluded to the small provision that is
made for original research in this country, and the stress that
is on almost all original investigators to throw themselves away
as teachers in order to gain a livelihood. It is important that
we have original investigation in science, but capitalists must
furnish the money to defray the expenses. But because a man
or woman turns to teaching rather than investigation, they do
not throw themselves away. Teaching is as high and honorable
a calling as investigating nature’s laws.</p>

<p>The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union celebrated its
tenth anniversary on December 23. We are told that this
organization numbers 100,000 members, and that they are scattered
all over the land. Here we find the cause of the stir and
hubbub in the country on the temperance question. It began
in the Ohio crusade, among the women. They used prayer
and religious songs and earnest entreaties, flavored with the
spirit of Christianity, and they have won; yes, they have won
the grandest victory of which mention is made in history for
temperance and our unfortunate fellow men. Celebrate the
return of the anniversary of the crusade. Do it with songs and
shouts of joy, and continue to work till the end.</p>

<p>We find the following summary of an interview with Whittier
in the <i>Sun</i>: “Whittier said that Hawthorne, Emerson, Longfellow,
and himself had always been friends. There were no jealousies,
and each took a pride in the work and successes of the
others. They would exchange notes upon their productions,
and if one saw a kindly notice of the other it was always cut
out and sent to him. Hawthorne was by the others regarded
as the greatest master of the English language. Whittier describes
himself as unlike any of the rest, for he never had any
method. When he felt like it he wrote, and neither had the
health nor the patience to revise his work afterward. It usually
went as it was originally completed. Emerson wrote with great
care, and would not only revise his manuscript carefully, but
frequently reword the whole on the proof sheets. Longfellow,
too, was a very careful writer. He would lay his work by and
then revise it. He would often consult with his friends about
his productions before they were given to the world. ‘I was
not so fortunate,’ says the Quaker poet. ‘I have lived mostly
a secluded life, with little patience to draw upon, and only a few
friends for associates. What writing I have done has been for
the love of it. I have ever been timid of what I have penned.
It is really a marvel to me that I have gathered any literary
reputation from my productions.’”</p>

<p>The prospect is good that we shall have erected at Chautauqua
in the spring about six new cottages, to be used by the
School of Languages. They will be located on the new land
recently purchased by the Association. This will introduce
public buildings on that part of the grounds, and make the lots
for private cottages more desirable. The outlook on the Lake
from this point is one of the finest to be found between Jamestown
and Mayville.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHY OF THE PLAN OF SALVATION.</h3>

<p>P. 177.—“Diomedes,” diˈo-meˌdes. A legendary hero of the Trojan
war—second in bravery to Achilles. Much space is devoted by Homer
in the <i>Iliad</i> to his exploits. He was a favorite of Minerva, and from
her received the gift of immortality. In his combats with the Trojans
he spared neither gods nor men, if Minerva assisted him. For this reason
Minerva speaks to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“War boldly with the Trojans, Diomed;</div>
<div class="verse i1">For even now I breathe into thy frame,—</div>
<div class="verse i1">…</div>
<div class="verse i1">Lo! I remove the darkness from thine eyes,</div>
<div class="verse i1">That thou mayst well discern the gods from men;</div>
<div class="verse i1">And if a god should tempt thee to the fight,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Beware to combat with the immortal race.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>P. 179.—“Clemens of Alexandria.” One of the early Christian
fathers, who lived at the close of the second and beginning of the third
centuries. Educated in the heathen philosophy, he was converted to
Christianity, and became a presbyter in the church. Clemens wrote
much, using the scientific methods of the philosophers in his exposition
of the doctrines of Christianity. His principal themes were exhortations
to the heathen to abandon idolatry, and treatises on Christian and Greek
literature.</p>

<p>“Minucius Felix,” Marcus. A native of Africa, but he came to
Rome, where he successfully practiced law until he was converted. He
is said to have been renowned for his eloquence. His most important
work for Christianity was <i>Octavius</i>, a dialogue between a Christian and
a heathen upon the merits of their respective religions.</p>

<p>P. 187.—“Reductio ad absurdum.” Reducing to an absurdity.</p>

<p>P. 189.—“Petrifaction,” pĕtˌri-făcˈtion. Turning into stone of an
animal or vegetable substance.</p>

<p>P. 199.—“Zeleucus,” ze-leuˈcus. A law-giver among the Locrians
(see Grecian History), who lived about 660 B. C. His laws were eminently
severe, but were observed by his people for a long time. Zeleucus is
said to have come to his death because a transgressor of one of his own
laws. He had decreed that no one should enter the senate house armed,
on a penalty of death. In a time of great excitement in war Zeleucus
broke the decree. It was remarked to him, and immediately he fell on
his sword, in vindication of the law.</p>

<p>P. 222.—“Daguerreotype,” da-gĕrˈo-tīp. So called from Daguerre,
the discoverer of this method of taking pictures.</p>

<p>P. 230.—“Permit me to write the ballads of a nation, and I care not
who makes her laws.” The idea is said to have originated with Andrew
Fletcher, of Saltoun, who wrote: “I knew a very wise man that
believed that if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need
not care who made the laws of a nation.”</p>

<p>P. 241.—“Modus operandi.” Manner of operation.</p>

<p>“Die.” The piece of metal on which is cut a device to impress on
coins, medals, etc.</p>

<p>P. 254. “Socinian.” Lælius Socinus was an Italian theologian
(1525-1562). His study led him to doubt certain doctrines, among them
that of the Trinity. His nephew, Faustus, who by his skeptical spirit
had made himself very obnoxious to the church, decided in 1574 to become
a religious reformer, and from the manuscripts of his uncle he
elaborated what was called the Socinian system. The negations of the
system include: The Trinity, the deity of Christ, the personality of the
devil, the native and total depravity of man, the atonement and eternal punishment.
It affirms that Christ was a divinely appointed man, and that in
the imitation of his virtues we find our salvation. The American Cyclopædia
says of the former use of this term: “The name Socinian, which
is so often given to those who hold Unitarian opinions as a term of reproach,
was for a century the honorable designation of a powerful and
numerous religious body in Poland, Hungary and Transylvania.…
The Racovian catechism, so called from its place of publication (Raków, in
Poland), compiled mainly from the writings of Socinus, is still the text-book
of faith and worship in many Hungarian and Transylvanian
churches.” Unitarianism is now the term applied to the doctrines of
Socinianism.</p>

<p>P. 258.—Translation of Latin in foot-note: The constant presence of
Christ in the heart brings pleasant communion, gracious consolation,
much peace.</p>

<p>P. 260.—“Subjectively.” By “moral light revealed subjectively” is
meant the light or truth which is natural, or in the mind of every subject
or thinker, and opposed to the light which comes <i>objectively</i>, or through
an object, as, in this case, the light which comes from the Bible. Subjective
and objective are terms of mental philosophy, of common use,
and applied generally to certainty or truth. “Objective certainty,” says
Watts, “is when the thing is true in itself; subjective when we
are certain of the truth of it. The one is in things, the other in our
minds.”</p>

<p>P. 266.—“Logos,” loˈgos. The <i>word</i>, literally. In ancient thought
it had two significations, one philosophical, where it meant the reason,
or that principle which regulates the affairs of the world; the other theological,
referring, as in the Gospel of St. John, to a distinct person
which both creates and redeems; here it is applied to man’s reason.</p>

<p>P. 273.—“Lacon.” The author of Lacon was Caleb Colton, an
English writer, born in 1780. He was educated at Cambridge and received
a vicarage in 1818, but soon became so dissipated as to utterly
ruin his prospects. He was obliged to flee to America on account of
debts incurred in gambling, but afterward went to France, where in
1832 he committed suicide. “Lacon, or Many Things in Few Words,”
is a collection of maxims, and is best known of his writings.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>HOW TO GET STRONG.</h3>

<p>P. 19.—“Navvy.” Short for navigator, formerly slang, but now a
recognized term applied to those employed in excavating canals, making
dykes and like work.</p>

<p>“Longshoremen.” Said to be abbreviated from <i>along shore men</i>.
“The Slang Dictionary” says that all people who get their livings by
the side of the Thames below bridges are called Long Shore folk. The
particular class to which Mr. Blaikie refers is that of laborers employed
about wharves.</p>

<p>P. 25.—“Tom Brown of Rugby.” The hero of the story, “Tom
Brown’s School Days,” by Thomas Hughes.</p>

<p>“Hares and Hounds.” A game sometimes called “paper hunt.” A
team of any number of players is formed, from which one is chosen as the
hare. To him is given a start of a few minutes called “law.” He
starts off with a bag of cut paper called “scent,” which he scatters as he
runs. When “law” is up the hounds or remainder of the team start in
pursuit, following “scent” as closely as possible. The game continues
until the hare is run to the ground or the players baffled.</p>

<p>P. 27.—“Turners.” During the time that Napoleon controlled Prussia
Friedrich Jahn, a German patriot, conceived the idea of forming
schools in which the young men should be trained in gymnastic exercises
and in patriotic sentiments, in order that eventually they might
drive the French from the country. These schools were called <i>Turnvereine</i>.
The first one was established in 1811, and when in 1813 the
country was called to arms, the Turners rendered signal service.
Though for a time prohibited in Germany, they were afterward reorganized
and have been introduced into various countries.</p>

<p>P. 41.—“Tantalus.” A character of Greek mythology, who, having
given offense to the gods, was punished in the lower world by confinement
in a river where the water always recedes from his lips, and the
branches over his head, laden with fruit, withdraw from his hand.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“So bends tormented Tantalus to drink,</div>
<div class="verse i1">While from his lips the refluent waters shrink.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Again the rising stream his bosom laves,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And thirst consumes him ’mid circumfluent waves.”—<i>Darwin.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>P. 50.—“La Ligne.” The line.</p>

pirogue. A kind of canoe formed out of a tree trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 85.—“Choate,” chote. (1799-1859.) Choate was sixty years of
age when he died, instead of fifty-five.</p>

<p>P. 87.—“Brougham.” See <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for November.</p>

<p>“Canning.” (1770-1827.) A British statesman.</p>

<p>P. 135.—“Double-first.” In the English universities one who wins
the highest honors in both the classics and mathematics is said to win
“a double-first.”</p>

<p>P. 136.—“Mazzini,” mät-seeˈnee. (1805-1872.) An Italian patriot
and revolutionist. He early devoted himself to bringing about the
unity of Italy, then divided and oppressed by Austria. In 1831 he was
banished, thereupon he formed a political organization to secure the
liberty of Italy and union of the states. In every way he worked to
gain his ends. In 1849 he assisted Garibaldi in his struggles for Italy’s
freedom, and later directed an insurrection in northern Italy. Mazzini
was the author of several works. Carlyle says of him: “I have had the
honor to know M. Mazzini for a series of years, and I can, with great
freedom, testify to all men that he, if I have ever seen one such, is a man
of genius and virtue—a man of sterling veracity, humanity and nobleness
of mind.”</p>

<p>P. 147.—“Bowdoin,” boˈdwin.</p>

<p>P. 156.—“Thwart.” A nautical term applied to the bench of a boat,

and so distinguished himself that he was given the chief command.
The Turks invading the country, Sobieski made a record which caused
him to be elected king upon the death of the monarch then ruling. His

Frederick devoted himself to the restoration and improvement of his
country. It is said that at his death he left to his nephew and successor,
“a surplus of $50,000,000, an army of 220,000 men, a territory increased

of the most expert and far reaching scientists of modern times. His
love for research led him to explorations early in life. In 1790 he
travelled through the principal countries of Europe, afterward publishing
the discoveries made by him on this journey. After this, for some
years he was employed in mining enterprises. In 1829 he joined an
expedition to the Ural and Altai mountains. In 1799 Humboldt went
to South America; on this journey he made extensive observations in

the Prussian court.</p>

<p>P. 253, c. 2.—“Orinoco,” Oˌrĭ-noˈco. Said to mean coiling snakes.</p>

<p>“Heine.” (1799-1856.) Heine was of Jewish parentage, but abandoned
his religion and adopted the Lutheran. His first book on his
travels in Italy was very successful. After this followed his first book
of songs, which contained many pieces of rare beauty. It filled all
Germany with enthusiasm. Heine spent his last years in great suffering, a

</div>
</div>

<p>“Schleiermacher,” schleīˈer-mä-ker. (1768-1834.) One of the most

<p>P. 255, c. 1.—“Schopenhauer,” shoˈpen-howˌer. (1788-1860.) He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
studied in the German universities, and afterward devoted himself to
philosophical studies. His works on the will are the best known.</p>

<p>“Zoöphytes,” zōˈo-fit. “Mollusca,” mol-lŭsˈca. “Annelida,” an-nĕlˈi-da;
“Arachnida,” a-răchˈni-da. “Crustacea,” krus-tāˈshe-a;

<h3>READINGS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE.</h3>

<p>P. 255, c. 2.—“Foraminifera,” fo-rămˌi-nĭfˈe-ra.</p>

<p>P. 257, c. 1.—“Hot Springs.” These are in reality Artesian wells, the
water rising from great depths. In some places the warm water is
utilized, as in Würtemberg, where manufactories are warmed by the
water sent through them in pipes. The water is usually pure and the
temperature quite uniform. Among the most famous examples of hot
springs are those of Arkansas—fifty-seven in number—those of Virginia,
and the geysers of Iceland.</p>

<p>“Wells of Bath.” Bath is the chief town of Somersetshire, England,
and takes its name from its baths. The springs which furnish
these are four in number, and discharge nearly 200,000 gallons of water a
day.</p>

<p>Many interesting examples of changes in level might be noted. Scotland
in less than an hundred years has been raised from 15 to 20 feet.
As distinctly have the coast lines been traced, says Hugh Miller, as
“between two contiguous steps of a stair, covered the one by a patch of
brown, the other by a patch of green, in the pattern of the stair-carpet.”
In Norway and Sweden a rising has been proven to be going on in the
northern part, and a sinking in the southern part.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY READINGS.</h3>

<p>P. 259, c. 2.—“Cervantes,” cer-vânˈtēs, sä-a-veˈdrä. (1547-1616.)
A Spanish author. The work referred to is “Don Quixote.” Of it a
writer in the <i>American Cyclopædia</i> says: “In this work Cervantes hit
the vulnerable point of his age. The common sense of the world had
long rebelled against the mummeries of knight errantry, and the foolish
books that still spoke of chivalry of which not a vestige remained.
People who had smiled when the idea presented itself to their minds,
burst out in laughter when Cervantes gave it the finishing stroke.” Beside
“Don Quixote,” Cervantes wrote several satires, dramas and
stories.</p>

<p>“Knight-errantry,” nītˈ ĕr-rant-re. The character, manners and adventures
of wandering knights.</p>

<p>“Butler,” Samuel. (1612-1680.) An English poet. He led an uneventful
life, being employed at different times as amanuensis or secretary
to men of high standing. When fifty-one years of age he wrote
<i>Hudibras</i>, his “fine satire.” The hero, Sir Hudibras, is said to have
been drawn from Sir Samuel Luke, a Puritan officer. The poem ridicules
by satire and exaggeration the actions, severity, morals and dress
of the Puritans. It was never entirely finished. Butler was very popular
with Charles II., and his court for a time, but finally died in
poverty.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>COMMERCIAL LAW.</h3>

<p>P. 260, c. 1.—“Inhibition,” ĭn-he-bĭshˈun. Restraint, hinderance.</p>

<p>“Judicature,” jūˈdi-ca-tūre. The administration of justice.</p>

<p>P. 260, c. 2.—“Common-law.” According to the <i>American Cyclopædia</i>,
common-law in the United States means the entire English law,
including even the foreign elements intermingled with it, in distinction
from the civil law generally received among European nations, and from
the canon law, except so far as adopted in the ecclesiastical courts of
England. Burrill defines it as “the unwritten law, or that body of customs,
rules and maxims which have acquired their binding power and
the force of law, in consequence of long usage, recognized by judicial
decisions, and not by reason of statutes now extant.” Of its origin, Sir
Matthew Hale says it is as “undiscoverable as the head of the Nile.”</p>

<p>“Norman-French.” The language of Normandy, a former northwestern
province of France. By the Norman conquest (1066) Norman
French became the language of the court and of equity in England.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>READINGS IN ART.</h3>

<p>The “Readings in Art” are compiled and condensed from “Architecture,
Classic and Early Christian,” by T. R. Smith and G. Slater.</p>

<p>P. 262, c. 1.—“Archaic.” Old; ancient; characterized by antiquity
or obsoleteness.</p>

<p>“Mausoleums,” mau-so-lēˈums. A tomb or monument. From Mausoleus,
king of Caria, to whom Artemisia, his widow, erected a stately
monument.</p>

<p>“Votive offerings.” From Latin <i>votum</i>—a vow. A tablet, picture,
or anything dedicated by the vow of the worshipers. “Additional
embellishments of flowers and <i>votive</i> garlands.”—<i>Motley.</i></p>

<p>“Doric.” There are several different accounts of the origin of the
Doric order. It is stated that Dorus, a king of Achaia, built a temple
in Argos, and this was found by chance to be in that manner which we
call Doric. Some say the arrangement of the order was that of a primitive
log hut. It is so called from Doris. Beside the Doric temples
mentioned here there are fragments of this style of architecture to be
seen in the temple of Theseus at Athens, in the Propylæa on the Acropolis,
in the temple of Zeus at Olympia, and in various other localities in
Greece and southern Italy. The form of the Doric building was the
same as in the Ionic and Corinthian.</p>

<p>“Ictinus,” ic-tiˈnus. He was the architect of several Doric temples;
the Parthenon, the temple of Apollo at Phigalia, and the one at Eleusis.
No details of his life are known.</p>

<p>“Rock.” This rock is the Acropolis.</p>

<p>“Entablature,” “cella,” “pediment.” See notes in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
for November.</p>

<p>“Flat pitch.” A roof that has less than the usual elevation in the center.</p>

<p>P. 262, c. 2.—“Stylobate,” styˈlo-bāte. Literally a basement to a
column. It is synonymous with pedestal, but is applied to an uninterrupted
and unbroken base, while pedestal is an insulated support.</p>

<p>“Entasis,” ĕnˈta-sĭs. A gentle, almost imperceptible swelling of the
shaft of a column.</p>

<p>“Ionic.” This style of architecture was so called from Ionia, where
it took its rise. Its origin is not certain. A writer says: “The explanation
of Vitruvius is that the Ionian colonists, on building a temple to
Diana, wished to find some new manner that was beautiful. Following
the method which they had pursued with the Doric (proportioning the
column according to the dimensions of a man), they imparted to this the
delicacy of the female figure.” The distinctive feature in the three orders
is the capital of the column. In the Doric this is very simple; a
curved moulding, round like the shaft, is surmounted by a large square
block or <i>abacus</i>. In the Ionic the capital has two scroll-like ornaments,
called volutes. There are more mouldings used, and the proportions
are more slender. Asia Minor contains numerous remains of Ionic
architecture. The Erectheium at Athens is the best known. The temple
of Diana was included among the seven wonders of the world, as
was the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, another Ionic temple recently
discovered.</p>

<p>“Vestiges.” Latin, Vestigium. Marks of the foot on the earth.
Tracks, traces, signs. “What vestiges of liberty or propriety have they
left.”—<i>Burke.</i></p>

<p>“Corinthian.” Vitruvius says of this order that it was arranged “to
represent the delicacy of a young girl whose age renders her figure more
pleasing and more susceptible of ornaments which may enhance her
natural beauty.” The Corinthian capital is the most ornamented of the
three orders. It is generally formed of various arrangements of acanthus
leaves, and is much larger and more showy than the others. The
monument of Lysicrates at Athens is the best example of this style.</p>

<p>“Cyclopean,” cy-clo-pēˈan. Pertaining to a class of giants, who had
but one eye in the middle of the forehead. They were said to inhabit
Sicily, and to be assistants in the workshops of Vulcan, fabled to be
under Mt. Etna.</p>

<p>P. 263, c. 1.—“Jupiter Capitolinus.” This temple was built in the
early days of Rome, and is said to have derived its name from the
builders discovering, during the excavation, a freshly bleeding head
(<i>caput</i>). According to the interpretation of the sages this sign indicated
that the place should become the head of the world. The temple
was dedicated to Jupiter as king of the gods. From it the hill on
which it was situated took its name of the Capitoline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“Appian Way.” The way or road from Rome to Brundusium, constructed
partly by Appius Claudius, B. C. 313.</p>

<p>“Q. Metellus Macedonicus,” me-telˈlus măc-e-dŏnˈi-cus.</p>

<p>“Roman.” In the ground plan of Roman architecture there is a
great difference from the Egyptian and Greek styles. The first employed
the ellipse, the circle, the octagon, and combinations of these
various forms in their plan, while the rectangle was the almost inevitable
form in the two latter. Instead of the massive blocks of stone of former
buildings, the Romans used small stones cemented with a cement of extraordinary
power. They could build anywhere and of anything. The
roofs were arched and in domes; the openings almost invariably arches;
the columns and ornaments were generally varieties of Greek styles.</p>

<p>“Tetra style.” Having a portico of four columns in front. Tetra is
the Greek word for four.</p>

<p>“Vitruvius,” vi-trūˈvi-us. See notes in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for
October.</p>

<p>“Pseudo peripteral,” sūˈdō pe-rĭpˈte-ral. A peripteral temple had a
single row of columns all around it. The variation of the style which
existed in this temple led to its being called <i>pseudo</i>, or falsely peripteral.</p>

<p>“Maison Carrée,” mā-zong kăr-rā. The <i>Square House</i>, as the name
signifies, is a beautiful Corinthian temple, of rectangular form.
The temple was built when all France was under the rule of Rome.
Although the Square House was injured in the wars of the middle ages,
it has been restored, and is now used as a museum.</p>

<p>“Nimes,” neem. A city of France, about sixty miles northwest of
Marseilles.</p>

<p>“Baalbec,” bâlˈbek.</p>

<p>P. 263, c. 2.—“Flavian.” The emperor Vespasian, who began the
Colosseum, belonged to the house of Flavius, hence the name.</p>

<p>“Esquiline,” esˈqui-line; “Cœlian,” cœˈli-an.</p>

<p>“Pantheon,” pan-theˈon. Meaning <i>all the gods</i>. “In the year B. C.
27, on the occasion of the victory of Actium, when universal peace was
declared, the great edifice was dedicated to all the gods, and figures of
these in gold, in silver, in bronze, and in precious marbles were placed in
niches within it, and hence the name Pantheon.” It is now a Christian
church dedicated to the Virgin and All Saints, and is called the Rotunda.</p>

<p>P. 264, c. 1.—“Santa Sophia.” The church was not dedicated to a
saint, but to the spirit of wisdom (<i>sophia</i> is the Greek for wisdom), the
second person in the Trinity.</p>

<p>“Procopius.” See notes on “Greek History” in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
for November.</p>

<p>“San Vitale,” san ve-tâˈlā.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>SELECTIONS FROM AMERICAN LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>P. 264, c. 2.—“Vaudois,” vō-dwâ. A religious denomination called
sometimes the Waldenses, founded in the twelfth century, in Italy.</p>

<p>P. 265, c. 1.—“Nautilus,” nâuˈti-lŭs. A mollusk having a coiled
univalve shell of many chambers. As the animal grows new chambers
are continually formed, and the parts vacated are partitioned off into
air-tight chambers by thin, smooth plates.</p>

<p>P. 265, c. 2.—“Triton,” trīˈton. A marine deity in Greek mythology,

<h2 id="BANQUET_TO_CHAUTAUQUA_TRUSTEES">BANQUET TO CHAUTAUQUA TRUSTEES.<br />
<span class="smaller">GIVEN BY THE CITIZENS OF JAMESTOWN, N. Y.</span></h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In the parlors and dining hall of the Sherman House in
Jamestown, N. Y., on Wednesday evening, January 9th, the
Chautauqua Trustees assembled for a banquet, preparatory to
their annual meeting.</p>

<p>After an hour or more of social personal greeting the company,
about fifty in number, filed into the dining hall and took the
places indicated on their cards of invitation at the tables beautifully
adorned with fruits and flowers.</p>

<p>Ex-Governor R. E. Fenton, of New York, acting as presiding
officer of the evening, took his place at the head of the table,
having on his right President Lewis Miller, Vice President F.
H. Root, Esq., and others, and on his left Prof. J. H. Worman
and other members of the Chautauqua Board of Trustees. At
the other end of the main table were Robert N. Marvin, Esq.,
Dr. J. H. Vincent, Dr. J. T. Edwards, Rev. W. G. Williams, of
Jamestown, Mr. Clem Studebaker, of Indiana, and distinguished
residents of several other states.</p>

<p>After more than two hours spent at a most sumptuous repast
(eleven courses were on the bill of fare), the rarest delicacies of
Southern climes being lavishly provided, as well as the more
common edibles of our colder northern soil and streams, Ex-Governor
Fenton, rising in his place, gave the guests of the
hour words of warmest greeting. [We give a condensed report
of remarks offered.] He said: “We welcome you, gentlemen,
not so much because of what you are at your homes, although
that is, no doubt, a matter of congratulation from neighbors and
friends, not so much as representatives of a great religious denomination
whose membership is numbered by the millions—I
speak of the various branches of Methodism, whose institutions
are confessedly based upon religious intelligence and conviction,
and therefore a subject of congratulation. We welcome
you, gentlemen, mainly because you have come to the shores
of our beautiful lake and founded an institution elevating in its
influence, purifying in its character; which has found its way
through the sunny South, along the shores of the lakes, around
and over the plains, and over the mountains, even to the Pacific
Coast. Stopping not there, you have found your way to the islands
of the seas, and to the peoples in the countries beyond the seas.
If I should say less than this, Mr. Flood, who speaks through
more than thirty-five thousand monthly <span class="smcap">Chautauquans</span>, would
spring to his feet. I might say more, but, gentlemen, this enterprise
is carried forward not alone by Methodists, for, in a
catholic spirit, you have opened the doors to all denominations
and all people and invited them to join you, and those who
aspire to or desire to witness genuine moral and intellectual
progress. And, gentlemen, we welcome you to our town. We
should be glad, had it not been for the inclemency of the
weather, to have shown you the social and public progress of
our people. I might speak of our nine churches always well-filled
on the Sabbath day and at other seasons when opened,
and of one denomination about to build another church with
a capacity three times as large as the old one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“We should be glad to have you look at our manufacturing
interests, to see how extensive they are, to visit our grand Union
School building. We should be glad to introduce you to our
merchants, and have you see all that we are doing—these
things, the result of the enterprise and industry of our people.
We have no princely fortunes here, but we are prospering, and
though we have had but little time to go abroad, yet we promise
you, gentlemen of Chautauqua, that a portion of our leisure
days, increasing as the years go by, shall be devoted to visiting
you in the summer season at Chautauqua. [Applause.]
And now I ask you all to drink (water) to the health of Dr.
Vincent, who, by his great devotion, great abilities and organizing
power, with the calm judgment and wise counsels of President
Miller, have done so much to make Chautauqua a success.”
[Long continued applause.]</p>

<p>Dr. Vincent said substantially:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of Jamestown:—You have listened, as have we,
the representatives of the Chautauqua movement, to the kind
words of your fellow-townsman, and it is a source of very great
regret to me that I was not apprised in advance, of the fact
that I was expected to deliver a speech on this occasion; otherwise
I should have talked less to my fascinating friend, Mr.
Marvin, beside me, and eaten less, so that I might be in better
shape to speak.</p>

<p>“Governor Fenton has said something about the Chautauqua
Idea. It is an ‘enterprise’ which has a future, a destiny which
I think will transcend all the attainments and achievements of
the past. And those of us who are engaged in this movement,
and have watched it from its very beginning, and who know
something of the dreams of those who look out into the future,
are more likely to promise large things than those who simply
watch it from the outside. We may be disappointed. Chautauqua
may stand still one of these days and become a plain
little village on the lake. It will never be what Jamestown is,
but it depends upon Jamestown, as a representative city, for
much of the support, and of the sympathy which all such enterprises
demand. We have been tempted to think that from
Jamestown we have had comparatively little sympathy. I say
<i>tempted</i>, for the temptation has never had the slightest effect
upon my mind; but once in awhile it has been said: ‘Jamestown,
at the other end of the lake, fancies that you may build up
an organization at the northern end of the lake that will interfere
with interests at the south end.’ Frivolous indeed as
these suggestions were, they were strong enough to secure utterance
and cause trifling annoyance. As I recall the history
of Chautauqua, I remember that we have had pretty much the
whole of Jamestown present again and again at our great Assembly
gatherings. So far as the citizens of Jamestown are
concerned, we have never had for a moment any serious doubt
of their confidence in the enterprise, and their willingness to
aid us as far as they can, and there is not the slightest reason
for misunderstanding or rivalry, but every reason for mutual
faith and coöperation. [Applause.] And I should not be
surprised, gentlemen, if, in years to come, the boys of Jamestown
would go up to Chautauqua to the best boys’ school on
the continent [applause], and meet there the best teachers
from the best institutions, both of America and Europe, teachers
qualified not only to communicate knowledge to the boys
there assembled, but qualified to develop manhood and high
ideals of character and true intellectual strength and physical
culture. A gentleman said to me in the East the other day,
‘What we need in America to-day is a first-class school for boys,
a school of the very highest order, in which intellect, manners,
body, heart, social faculties, and all, shall be symmetrically developed,’
and I have confidence that, within a very few years,
just such a school will be planted at Chautauqua; and when I
think of the larger institution, for which we now have a charter
from the state legislature, an institution which will bring its
students from all parts of the United States, I see a number of
colleges constituting a university crowning those heights, and
commanding large sections of land on both sides of this lake,
and awakening a new and increased enthusiasm, not only
about the lake of Chautauqua, but all over the land, in the
great cause of popular education. [Applause.]</p>

<p>“Now, I do not betray any great plans which have already
been devised, but I give utterance to dreams and hopes which
I know exist in the minds of a great many Chautauqua workers,
when I say that the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle,
reaching as it does fifty thousand families in all parts of this
land, is silently gaining a constituency which will be increased
in less than five years to one hundred thousand, and which, in
the course of ten years, will number two hundred thousand
men and women, the most of them parents, who will be looking
about for a place in which to educate their children; and
if this city, increasing in wealth, increasing in culture, increasing
in enthusiasm in the great educational work, will only lay
hold of the largest conceptions concerning the Chautauqua of
the future, the sums of money which in the future you may
be induced to contribute to the founding of this enterprise will
receive response from one hundred thousand homes all over
the land, and the grandest endowments possessed by any institution
on the continent in the near future for the Chautauqua
University. [Applause.] For here is a little fact, of which
you need but to be reminded for a moment, that to-day in the
houses of the C. L. S. C. are growing up boys and girls, coming
from the farms and from the villages, who are to handle the
millions in the next twenty-five years. And when Tom comes
from the field and goes into business and makes his money,
and remembers the new interest awakened in him by his
father and mother, he is inspired by a public spirit, he looks at
the half million, more or less, which he is disposed to contribute,
and the institution which he will help will be his
father’s and mother’s <i>Alma Mater</i>, and his own <i>Alma Mater</i>,
and we may expect in this way the largest and grandest endowments
of any institution on the continent. I have been drinking
strongly of this cold water, and it always makes me feel
like talking, and I thank you for the privilege given me of expressing
the dreams which come to my mind of the institution
which you have so greatly honored, and whose annual meeting
brings us together so pleasantly to-night.” [Long continued
applause.]</p>

<p>Governor Fenton:—“I want to introduce to you one of our citizens
representing the great manufacturing industries of our city,
a gentleman who can talk well about them. I call upon Mr.
William Hall.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hall said: “Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that you have
raised the expectations of our friends in this announcement. I
never made any pretensions to an ability to talk, never made
any pretensions to eloquence, and, really, if I ever had, the
speech to which you have just listened would have completely
blotted out anything that I might have been tempted to say;
but this much I can say, I can make a plain statement, that I
have always felt the greatest sympathy myself for the enterprise
which has been founded upon our lake. Yet it is true,
that, busied by the cares of the new enterprises, I may at times
have forgotten to express those feelings and show that sympathy—but
it has always been present in my heart. I dare not
step out into the world, to speak concerning Chautauqua, but
I can speak of its effect upon the people in my factories, with
whom I daily associate, and in whose interests I feel the liveliest
interest. Many have come from foreign shores to make
their homes here. They have vague ideas of the efforts and
blessings which they are to strike in this American soil, and
everything influences and turns their thoughts, views, feelings
and aspirations. Some of them have never owned a bit of land
in the world. They are now inspired with self-respect in finding
themselves in possession of a better home, and I am looking
to see what this influence coming from Chautauqua will be
upon them. They can not attend Chautauqua as much as I
would like to have them. The Chautauqua meetings come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
a busy season. But they do go up there as often as they can,
and they are influenced. They do judge of the American
character. They get large aspirations by listening to those
speakers. They come home, and it is amusing and instructive
to hear them talk over what takes place up there. They speak
very largely of Dr. Vincent. There is no man in my factory
who attends there but thinks Dr. Vincent is the greatest man.
They say: Dr. Vincent was as great a man as any he introduced.
I am glad he is becoming popular on account of the
influence he can exert upon them and their children who are
to be the future inhabitants of this town. They are to hold in
their hands the destinies of wide reaches of this country, and it
is important that they should come under good influences. I
do not know of better influences than those coming down to us
from Chautauqua, and though we cannot be at Chautauqua,
our hearts are there, and our sympathies are there with you,
and, Doctor, when you throw the pebble in the pool, I may not
follow the pebble in its fall, but I hear the waves ripple by my
door.” [Applause.]</p>

<p>Governor Fenton: “The people of Jamestown all recognize
and admire the devotion of President Miller of Chautauqua.
Only one thing we cannot fully understand why he should live
in Akron instead of Jamestown.” [Laughter and applause.]</p>

<p>Lewis Miller, Esq., spoke briefly: “Akron is in Ohio. [Applause.]
It is the place of my birth.” He gracefully acknowledged
the good will of the citizens of Jamestown in honoring
the Chautauqua Board by this banquet and reception.
The management hopes ever to conduct the affairs for which
they are associated to the advantage of the local interests
about the lake, and, while Chautauqua was not organized for
the purpose of merely benefiting this local circle about the lake,
yet we expect its influence will extend until it reaches the uttermost
parts of this country and possibly of others. [Applause.]</p>

<p>Governor Fenton called upon Rev. W. G. Williams, of
Jamestown, to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams said: “I certainly had not the remotest idea
that Governor Fenton would ask me to say a word. I can
bring a very competent witness here at my side who will testify
that at nine o’clock the last possibility of a speech in me vanished;
and yet it gives me great pleasure to corroborate the
words of others representing Jamestown, as to the excellent
character of this city of which we are residents. I suppose I
ought to call myself a resident now, though I have only been
here about a year. I have been greatly pleased with all the
evidences of prosperity commented on by the speakers before
me, and I want to say just a word in reference to one point
mentioned by Dr. Vincent in his remarks—the lack of sympathy
on the part of this town with Chautauqua. I had seen the
situation as an outsider, being a resident of another town, and
had heard the remark made quite frequently, and now residing
nearly a year in Jamestown, and having carefully observed the
facts, I want to bear testimony to the strongest sympathy of
the people in Jamestown with the work in Chautauqua, and also
to the fact that this sympathy is growing. I believe that Dr.
Vincent in looking forward to that future of achievement will
find that Jamestown will not lack, but will always be ready with
appreciation of the work.”</p>

<p>Referring to his religious and ecclesiastical connections in
Jamestown, Mr. Williams said: “We are enlisted as Methodists
with our Baptist, Presbyterian, and Congregational brethren.
We are orthodox in Jamestown, I believe, trying to do an
orthodox work, and in this we are working in sympathy and in
coöperation with Chautauqua, and I join with others in extending
a hearty welcome, representing, if I may, the churches of
the town to these gentlemen, who come to represent a great institution
at Chautauqua.” [Applause.]</p>

<p>Gov. Fenton told a story about Dr. Flood’s failing to obtain
an original story from a notable writer, at the other end of the
lake, and about his own recommendation of a novel which was
substituted therefor.</p>

<p>Dr. Flood said:—“Gov. Fenton takes proper credit for
‘Lavengro’ appearing in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. There is a gentleman
who makes his home, during the summer season, at the
head of the lake, and there was a time when the lower end
came to the rescue of the upper end. A gentleman had guaranteed
to furnish an original story, but when the time came for
the work to begin, he failed, and I failed to pay the thousand
dollars. Governor Fenton, anxious, doubtless, for the reputation
of the upper end of the lake, did suggest that I ought to examine
‘Lavengro.’ I went to George Borrow and borrowed. I borrowed
generously, and I do not doubt in the least but the one
hundred and seventy-five thousand readers of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
were quite as well pleased with ‘Lavengro’ as they would
have been with the original story, unless our friend, President
Miller, would have been better pleased with the other story,
because it was to be on the greenback line and opposed to monopolies.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> was born in two cities; in Jamestown
and Meadville. It is a little remarkable, but nevertheless
a fact, the three states that furnish the most subscribers to <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>, New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are the three
states associated with the birth of the magazine. It got its name
in Ohio. The name was given when Doctor Vincent and I were
riding in the cars in Ohio. The magazine was printed first in
Meadville, Pa., and it was shipped to Jamestown, from which
point the first number was mailed to subscribers, after which
the offices were removed to Meadville. I am gratified that the
citizens of Jamestown have at last been awakened from a sort
of Rip Van Winkle sleep on this question of Chautauqua, and
have, with a sort of exclamation point at this banquet, met
the Board of Trustees and the management of Chautauqua with
a very hearty and cordial reception.</p>

<p>“This is the line where we cross from the first decade into the
second decade of Chautauqua history.” Here the speaker told
a laughable incident connected with a dissolute fellow who
disturbed a Free Methodist watch-meeting by an untimely
blowing of a horn and the exclamation, “My name is
Gabriel, and I come once in a hundred years.” [Laughter.]
“Now, Mr. President, our name is Chautauquans, and to
Jamestown we come for the first time in ten years. We hope
to come more frequently in the future.” [Applause.]</p>

<p>Governor Fenton introduced Mr. Marvin, who, after a little
pleasantry, spoke concerning the idea broached by Dr. Vincent.
“It has been said that the citizens of Jamestown have not
manifested quite as much warmth of feeling toward the Chautauqua
association which you have founded upon this lake, and
which is in such a prosperous condition. This is not true. We
have been in sympathy with you. Our heart’s feelings have
been with you, though I am free to say, perhaps we have not
sufficiently manifested it. We are glad to have you present on
this occasion, and we hope in the future that we may make
ourselves known to you more strongly than in the past. [Applause.]
But I should say that, strictly from a business point
of view, there is not that wealth in Jamestown that many of
you think. But few of our citizens are wealthy. Many are
well-to-do, but what they have is so invested in their various
enterprises that they have not that ready money to invest in
outside operations. Perhaps this fact has controlled to some
extent the monied interests which otherwise would have gone
to assist you at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>“Now gentlemen, we rejoice that you have come to the shores
of the lake. We rejoice that you have founded that city in the
woods, and we hope to bear stronger proofs of our sympathy
hereafter.”</p>

<p>Dr. J. T. Edwards, of Randolph, being introduced humorously
referred to the royal furnishings of the banquet, the superabundance
of which might make, as Dr. Holmes has wittily
said, many families happy. Looking upon the delicious oysters
he had been reminded of two speakers at a feast in Egg
Harbor—one was classic and made references to Brutus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Cassius and other men unknown to the lowly oystermen—the
other by one who swinging his arms and with loud voice exclaimed:
“Fellow-citizens, the last time I had the pleasure of
visiting your town, I came to the conclusion that the Egg Harbor
oysters were superior to those of Saddle Rock.” [Laughter
and applause.] This was saying the right thing in the right
place, and at once took hold of the Egg Harbor oystermen.
We can not always do it.</p>

<p>Becoming more serious, the speaker said he believed this to
be the best age of the world, and Chautauqua a grand achievement
resting on this beautiful lake, more like the beautiful
Windermere than any he had elsewhere seen, made classic by
the writings of Coleridge and Wilson, and others. I extend
my congratulations also on this occasion, and feel myself to be
present with these citizens of Jamestown.</p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Worman being introduced by ex-Governor Fenton,
said: “In a large place in the city of Berlin, among the many
paintings in the gallery of the king there is one that attracted
my attention when I was a boy. It is a coronation scene of
King William IV. He is in the act of taking from the people their
promise of being faithful to him. And to-night as Dr. Vincent
spoke to you of the promise that had come to him from this
side, I was reminded of that picture, and I see now in place of
the king coming to ask his subjects their faith, this leader of
Chautauqua standing before me asking your fealty for the good
work begun upon this lake; and, as was written under the picture
in letters that are never to be effaced, crowned by many a
jewel: ‘This yes is mine’—so I see written upon your hearts
in undying language, the promise to Chautauqua and its honored
leader, a <span class="smcap">Yes</span> for the support of that enterprise, that it
may never die so long as civilization has a home on this lake.”
[Long continued applause.]</p>

<p>At a late hour the company separated for their homes and
places of entertainment, all being impressed with the genuine
friendship of the citizens of Jamestown for the Chautauqua
Assembly.</p>

<h3>CHAUTAUQUA TRUSTEES.</h3>

<p>The annual meeting of the Trustees of the Chautauqua Assembly
was held in the gentlemen’s parlors of the Sherman
House, Jamestown, N. Y., January 9th and 10th, Lewis Miller,
Esq., President of the Board, in the chair. There were
present Vice President F. H. Root, of Buffalo, Dr. J. H. Vincent,
Mr. Clem Studebaker, of Indiana, Dr. J. T. Edwards,
Revs. J. Leslie, H. H. Moore, and a number of others. The
old board of officers was reëlected with this exception: Mr. W.
A. Duncan, of Syracuse, was elected trustee and secretary of
the Assembly and superintendent of the grounds. Mr. Duncan
is a leading Congregationalist of Syracuse, N. Y. He is a man
of fine business tact, of indefatigable industry, of executive
force, and a thorough Christian gentleman. Mr. Duncan has
had large experience in the management of Chautauqua matters,
having been Dr. Vincent’s right hand man for several
years, and will enter upon his work under the most auspicious
circumstances. Dr. Vincent outlined his work for the summer
of 1884, but the details of his plans were not arranged so that
he could inform the board who the lecturers would be on any
given days in August next. The finances of the Assembly were
found to be in a more satisfactory condition than some trustees
had expected. Taken all in all the business of the Assembly
is in a healthy condition, and the program for the coming season
promises to be an unusually brilliant one. A number of
new cottages will be erected when the spring opens, the facilities
for reaching the grounds will be improved, and the hotel
accommodations will be excellent and at prices to suit the
purses of all visitors. The business transacted was of a
routine character, but the results will be apparent the coming
summer in the improved condition of the grounds and public
buildings at Chautauqua.</p>

<h2 id="TALK_ABOUT_BOOKS">TALK ABOUT BOOKS.</h2>


<p>Köstlin’s “Life of Luther”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> is really an important contribution to
our biographical literature. The fourth centennial has just been celebrated
in all Protestant countries, and much valuable information
given to the people from the pulpit and the press. The Reformation
and the principal agent God used to accomplish it are now discussed
as they have not been before for five centuries—yet the subject is by
no means exhausted. This latest book from the pen of a learned
German so well qualified, and thoroughly furnished for his work,
will be read with unusual interest by thousands whose attention has
recently been directed to the life and time of the great reformer.
The Professor, whose larger work in two volumes is a classic, has also
wrought well in this, and given us a real biography that presents its
subject fairly. All essential facts are freely admitted, even when disparaging,
and any one by attentive reading will gain a better knowledge
of Luther, of his homes and his friends. The author, who did his
work well, doubtless appears to better advantage in his own vernacular
than in the translation, which, though creditable as very plain English,
might be improved by re-casting some sentences, and by a little more
careful proof reading.</p>

<p>“The Old Testament Student” is a well filled, ably conducted
monthly magazine, published at Chicago for the “American Institute
of Hebrew,” subscription price, $2.00. It can hardly fail to be useful
to all Bible students, particularly those who desire a more thorough acquaintance
with the original.</p>

<p>“Mottoes of Methodism”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> is an unassuming but beautiful little volume,
and would be found a real treasure in any Christian family. It is
simply a selection of brief suggestive passages from the prose writings of
John, and the poetry of Charles Wesley; harmonized with a passage of
Scripture for each day of the year. Some other title, we think, as
“Themes for Daily Meditation,” “Helpful Suggestions from Reliable
Sources,” would better indicate the character of the book, which is intensely
evangelical, but, in no sense, distinctively Methodistic.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
